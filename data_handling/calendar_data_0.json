The rally was also held in the last year with the same objectives. Goals of the rally are to criticize Jogye Order for its responsibility on Dongguk University\u2019s present conflicts related to President Han Tae-sik (Bogwang) and to guarantee the school\u2019s autonomy from the order.\nAt 11:00 A.M., approximately 200 people, about 150 Donggukians and 50 people who are related to Dongguk University, gathered together in Manhae Hall. As soon as the march began, the marchers were obstructed by police officers because of a cow, which was prepared by the GSC, was not reported to participate in the rally. Scuffles broke out between the police and the GSC, and the cow was not able to go with the marchers. The parade was started from Chungmu-ro where Dongguk University is located, passed Myeong-dong and finally to Jogyesa Temple.\nAfter several speeches from students, the GSC and the gathered students tried to deliver request proposal to Jogye Order together, but police officers blocked the way. Therefore, only ten representatives were allowed to go to deliver the request proposal to the persons concerned of the Jogye Order at the temple gate. The request proposal involves following three demands: Jogye Order has to stop intervening in the school matters and should guarantee the school\u2019s autonomy, every sunim who spoiled the school needs to apologize and resign, and board of directors should be reformed in a more democratic way.",

    "text": "My husband is being posted to Darwin for work and we have decided to drive there. We are going in January and I know this is the wet season. My question is, do you think it will be safe travelling the Stuart Hwy to Darwin in a Holden Sedan at the start of January?\nWe plan on stopping at all the main towns for the night. I just worry about flooding on the Hwy and we are travelling with a child and want to make sure we are doing the right thing.\nJust use common sense. As long as you don't drive into any water deeper than 200mm, and you stick to the road and sealed parking bays (i.e. don't pull off the road into any soft shoulders), there is no problem at all. It's a normal highway.\nOf course there is always a chance of major flooding with the highway being cut by water deeper than that, which means you would have to wait for the water to go down before you can continue your journey.\nIt does happen nearly every year, sometimes more than once, but I really can't predict when and where or for how long. Only Petrus can tell you :-).\nKeep an eye on the weather forecast. Big rains do not come out of nowhere, they come out of big, monsoonal depressions. If one of those is heading for the region, then you may have to reconsider your driving plans.\nAnd of course, always check the road reports.\nHow did the travel go?\nThat must have been a long journey. I am thinking of traveling around Australia one day. How did the travel go?\nIn my opinion traveling from Melbourne to Darwin in January might be a bit uneasy, especially when you are planning to do it without any rescue baggage. There can be flash floods, and within just a matter of seconds the entire highway can become dangerous to travel on. Furthermore, while stopping at major cities for the night is a good idea, it doesn't take you out from the risk of facing floods. And of course, you are not going to like the idea of being stranded on the terrace of a roadside motel till rescue workers pull you guys out. Think over it. I guess you can come up with a better alternative than this.\nEditor's note: I removed your totally unrelated spam link, mate. If your comment wasn't a dead give away that you have never been anywhere near the north, the link certainly was.\nWell, we did it and thankfully had not one problem. There was rain but that stopped our journey because we were lucky enough that the water was off the Ed by the time we reached the apparent flooded areas.... It was a very long drive and all I can say is prepare\u2026 prepare\u2026 prepare. :-) Make sure you have everything you need in case of emergency and you should be fine.... Wishing you safe travels!\nI hope you have a safe trip to Darwin.\nI hope you have a safe trip!\nThat's a long trip you're planning mate, this is what you need: axe, sleeping bag, one huge sack of food, around 30-40 litres of water, some things your kid would like to do, phone, tent, 30-40 litres of oil, torch, 3 knifes, extra tyres (8 tyres), building tools.\nJoin in and write your own page!

    "text": "Both the federation of states and the federal super-state describe the same zero-sum game from different angles. Either there is one single state of Europe (federalism), in which case there are no national member states; or else the national member states remain Europe\u2019s rulers, in which case there is no Europe (inter-governmentalism). Within this framework of thought, whatever Europe gains, the individual nations lose. And this is true whether one is for a given option or against it. Caught up in the false alternatives of the national gaze, we are given the choice between no Europe or no Europe.\nThe decline of the nation-state is really a decline of the specifically national content of the state and an opportunity to create a cosmopolitan state system that is better able to deal with the problems that all nations face in the world today. Economic globalisation, transnational terrorism, global warming: the litany is familiar and daunting. There are a host of problems that are clearly beyond the power of the old order of nation-states to cope with. The answer to global problems that are gathering ominously all around and that refuse to yield to nation-state solutions is for politics to take a quantum leap from the nation-state system to the cosmopolitan state system. Politics needs to regain credibility in order to craft real solutions.\nMore than anywhere else in the world, Europe shows that this step is possible. Europe teaches the modern world that the political evolution of states and state systems is by no means at an end. National realpolitik is becoming unreal, not only in Europe, but throughout the world. It is turning into a lose-lose game.\nEuropeanisation means creating a new politics. It means entering as a player into the meta-power game, into the struggle to form the rules of a global order. The catchphrase for the future might be: move over America, Europe is back.\nThe EU uses money for things that the various countries governments would not dream of spending it on, such as regional projects, culture, the arts and so on. The governments would probably just use that money to bail out banks..",

    "text": "HOW do we explain why 5.5m French voters in the first round of the presidential elections voted for far-right parties that are xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist and ultra-nationalist? Sounding off about the wrongness of the vote will not help understand the reasons underlying their choice. Everybody in politics needs to begin an urgent, thorough and much-needed self-criticism.\nThe vote may have been a valuable wake-up call for France if it opens the eyes of party leaders and revives the debate on how to build a nation based on justice and solidarity. What vanished in April was the comforting thought that although everything was changing in the world outside, in French politics everything could stay the same; that two ageing parties, the Gaullists and the Socialists, could share power as they had done for 30 years.\nPeople have sensed for some time that these two political forces are worn out. Their historic mission seems to have ended. Each in its own way gives the impression of an organisation going nowhere, with crumbling infrastructures, no organisation or programme, no ideology, no identity and no compass for the journey ahead.\nPrevious elections had already shown that neither party was capable of addressing the needs of millions of people who are genuinely frightened by the new realities of the post-industrial world that has emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. The disposable workers, the underclasses of the banlieues, the long-term unemployed, the excluded, the many people pushed into early retirement, the young people in precarious jobs, the families on the brink of poverty. For all these, the recent past has brought years of fear and anxiety, with many familiar landmarks apparently gone forever.\nThe Socialist party in particular, with almost no working-class people in its local organisations and several leaders in the supertax bracket, gives the impression that it lives on another planet, light years from the experiences of ordinary people. It has shown itself remarkably insensitive to what Daniel Mermet describes as \u201cthe sufferings of under-France\u201d.\nWhat about the right? Some conservative politicians see the far right as untouchable, but others have been happy to do electoral deals with it. The former liberal leader, Michel Poniatowski, recently wondered in public whether it was \u201cany more immoral to accept the votes of communists, who murdered millions of people in Europe, than those of the National Front\u201d (1). This perverse logic allowed Christian Democrat leaders of the Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise (UDF) to accept National Front votes in 1998 to be elected to the presidency of five French regions.\nWhile this plague infected the inner workings of France\u2019s political institutions, was it reasonable to imagine that France would remain immune to the upsurge of far-right politics in its immediate neighbours (see Fascism isn\u2019t what it used to be, by Jean-Yves Camus, in this issue)? Or likely that France would be the exception when, like other European countries, its social fabric has been violently rent in the name of modernity: by liberalism and globalisation, European unification, the decline in national sovereignty, the abandonment of the franc, the disappearance of national borders, the hegemony of the United States, multiculturalism, loss of identity and the crisis of the welfare state?\nAll this happened in the context of the end of the industrial era and technological transformations that led to widespread economic insecurity and terrible social malaise. In such a context, with competition raised to the status of a natural imperative, an increase in violence and criminality was inevitable. The abruptness and brutality of these changes meant that uncertainties are accumulating as horizons have been lost, the world seems less clear, and history appears to defy logic and understanding. Ordinary people have felt abandoned by governments of both right and left; unsurprisingly, since the press describes them as corrupt, as liars and cheats.\nMany people feel lost and panicky; as Tocqueville put it,\"since the past no longer illuminates the present, the human spirit walks in darkness\". Old magicians have returned to conjure with this new obscurantism, this breeding-ground of fear, confusion and resentment. Their rhetoric is demagogic, authoritarian and racist; they talk of a return to the old values (work, family, motherland) and blame foreigners, Arabs and Jews for all the disorders, social problems and insecurities. Immigrants are an easy target, always available, because they symbolise social upheavals, and among the lowest-income earners they are seen as unwanted competition.\nAlthough it is absurd, hateful and even criminal, the rhetoric of the National Front has long appealed to more than one in four French people according to the opinion polls (2). On 21 April it gained the electoral approval of millions (30% of the unemployed, 24% of workers, 20% of young people and 17% of employers).\nThe Republican awakening expressed in street demonstrations all over France translated into anti-Le Pen votes on 5 May. Neo-fascism will not be voted in during the parliamentary elections in June either. But once the moment of fear has passed, if the parties carry on as before, with privatisation, dismantling public services, creating pension funds and accepting sackings to keep shareholders happy, if they continue to deny people\u2019s desires for a society that is fairer, more fraternal, more based on solidarity \u2014 then there is no guarantee that fascism, in alliance with the usual collaborators, will not win next time.\n(1) Lib\u00e9ration, 20 March 1998.\n(2) Le Monde, 13 April 1996.",

    "text": "Far Left Van Jones Admits that Trump Can Win and Gives Major Warning to Democrats - Video - Stumpin' For Trump!\nCNN contributor and former Obama aide Van Jones put out a warning to his fellow Democrats on Friday: Donald Trump is probably going to win the White House.\nIn the Facebook video, Jones credited Trump\u2019s ability to understand and use social media and reality television as well as his appeal to black voters as reasons he will likely win the White House in November.\nJones likened Trump to Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama in the sense that they all excelled in a new medium that no other politician could easily master.\n\u201cJust like FDR changed the rules of the game because he mastered radio, he was able to take radio and just completely master that \u2014 then you had JFK and JFK was able to master television \u2014 new medium, new master, new president,\u201d Jones said.\nHe continued to detail how Trump has been able to use his celebrity to appeal to parts of the Democratic base, especially black voters.\n\u201cIf only 70 percent don\u2019t like Donald Trump, that means 30 percent are open to his argument, if he gets half of those, he\u2019s president,\u201d Jones said.\nA Public Policy Polling report released on Monday showed Jones might be correct in his opinion that Trump is winning over large segments of the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal voting bloc. The poll showed that in the swing state of Ohio, Trump would garner 15 percent of the African American vote against Clinton, with another 11 percent undecided.\nThat is huge increase from the 4 percent of the black vote Mitt Romney received in Ohio during the last presidential election.\nWell, well, well, even the ex-Obama-Czar-self-proclaimed communist understands and sees how Trump can win and be our next President! Wow! I\u2019m a bit impressed, but I wouldn\u2019t trust Van Jones with a lollipop either! Trump is pulling in some of the more modest democrats over to vote for him, and with the help of these two infamous Internet sensations, Diamond and Silk, created a place for them to do just that, called \u201cDitch and Switch\u201d, for anyone who either voted democrat all these horrible years and now sees the \u201clight\u201d in voting Trump, or whom never voted before and wants to sign up as soon as possible to exercise their constitutional right to vote, they can go to Diamond and Silk\u2019s website, and sign up. They can help direct you to the right place. Thanks, Van Jones, for your analysis of a Trump win, and he can do this, if every ethnic group would just open their eyes to see what the last 7 years have really done to them; not for the \u201cfreebies\u201d they get, for as long as they are listed poor, they can get the freebies, but is that what you really want? Just the freebies that this administration \u201cgives\u201d you? And where do you think that money comes from? Thin air? The upper clouds? Take heed, people, realize, that in history, in other parts of the world, where \u201cfreebies\u201d were a given because the people were poor and destitute, they were \u201ccontrolled\u201d by that government as long as they did the government\u2019s bidding, they got the freebies, so they just didn\u2019t work or even try looking. Then the government puts them to work, moves them to high rise buildings, stuffs other families with them in small apartments, and makes them go to work in plants, day in day out, but they get free housing, free food (which is rationed out periodically), and free stuff, but then it gets pulled because the government can\u2019t afford any more free stuff (phones, ipads, ect.). Take heed, this has happened, and it can happen again. Trump will get you back to a job you want and be proud of working because he\u2019ll limit the regulations of businesses who hire workers who want to work, and not hire out to foreigners either. You deserve a job, you\u2019ll get a job. Get off the freebie stuff because it\u2019s not going to last you a lifetime. Socialism only lasts long enough before the gov\u2019t runs out of money to sustain it.\nCommentary: Are polls underestimating Trump\u2019s support?",

    "text": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world. Their collective early success indicates that they get the punchline to the joke of 21st century retail\u2014that the retail of the future won't be merchant led, it will be Product led.\nBest of luck, Valerie Casey. A bricks-and-mortar nation turns its lonely eyes to you.",

    "text": "Parenting Podcasts: You Aren\u2019t Alone!\nWhen you follow someone online, you get a glimpse into their life. Suddenly instead of feeling alone, you feel validated in your decisions, and heck you might even learn something along the way!\nParenting podcasts offer this, and can help remind parents that whatever problem they\u2019re facing, they\u2019re not alone.\nListening into shows, or reading people\u2019s stories online, can feel like you\u2019re eavesdropping on their lives. However by being allowed to peak in, you suddenly realise that a lot things about parenting are universal.\nWe all do a lot of the things the same.\nWe also do a lot of things differently, and it\u2019s always fascinating to hear how others live their lives, and parent their children.\nWhether you agree or disagree, it still makes for a great conversation.\nThe Parenting View is one of these shows that has just started up, promising to get conversations going about all things parenting.\nMaria Foy, creator and host of the podcast The Parenting View, says \u201cA lot of parents can get disillusioned by what they see online, but with a show like this, suddenly you\u2019re exposed to a conversation that is unfiltered.\u201d She also goes on to say \u201cNo two people parent the same, and everybody\u2019s life experiences are different \u2013 which makes these kind of conversations fascinating. When we stop and listen to others, we learn; and knowledge is power. We can choose what to do with that information however we want\u201c.\nAs mentioned in our \u201cPodcasts Are The New Black\u201d post, you can listen to a podcast anywhere, anytime. You do not have to sit down in front of a computer to do it.\nSo you could be doing your laundry, going for a walk, or feeding your baby and still be able to tune in and feel less alone as a parent.\nSo head on over to Soundcloud and start checking out the podcasts available. If you\u2019re interested, you can check out The Parenting View\u2019s own podcast HERE.\nYou can check it out, and subscribe to it, on iTunes or on Spotify (coming soon).",

I had to give it a try before venturing off on the road again to my next destination. Sally Bells Kitchen, opened 90 years ago in 1924. The establishment was founded by Sarah Cabell Jones and a business partner. Sarah and partner met at the Women\u2019s Exchange, a former nationwide movement, intended to teach women skills and financial independence.\nSally Bells Kitchen is known for their delicious boxed lunches. Items such as potato salad, chicken salad, tuna salad, deviled eggs, cheese wafers and an array of cup cakes are made fresh from scratch daily. They sell thousands of sandwiches, cupcakes and hundreds of pounds of salads each year. This establishment is very welcoming, friendly and certainly has southern charm. The staff is just wonderful!",

I wanted to do a kid cake that was elegant given her age. That was as far as I got until the morning of the day everyone was coming. Talk about a decorating block! I just couldn\u2019t think of anything. Fortunately on the walk with the dogs I got an idea. And it had to be done quickly as I had an hour to do this. Yikes!\nNot only does she like purple, she likes butterflies so I decided to go with that. I whipped up some buttercream icing like I did for these cupcakes. Before I added the purple I scooped some white into a decorating bag.\nCarefully place the top layer on and brush any loose crumbs off.\nIce the whole cake smoothing as best you can. Isn\u2019t this a great purple?\nNext I used the white frosting to outline the flowers and butterfly. Finally I got the consistency right and it flowed like it should. In the past I was squeezing with all my might. Too much work. I used the white pearls for the centers and the purple sugar for the petals and wings. I really need to problem solve getting the sugar where I want it to go. There was a bit of colouring outside the lines with this bit.\nTo finish it off I added some icing dots on the sides.\nThis entry was posted in Desserts and tagged apples, baking, buttercream icing, chocolate cake. Bookmark the permalink.\nWow! that\u2019s one heck of a cake:) It\u2019s beautiful!! I love the butterfly:) She\u2019s going to LOVE IT! Happy Birthday to your daughter\u2026.\nI can\u2019t wait for those pics\u2026I just love everything about your daughters cake! It came out beautifully!!!!!!\nThank you. \ud83d\ude42 His birthday is in June so I have time to plan!\ncan\u2019t wait! Have a Great weekend:) and as always thanks for sharing\u2026.\nThanks, I\u2019ll let her know.\nHappy Birthday to your daughter. That\u2019s certainly a cake and a half. She must have be thrilled.\nShe liked it. \ud83d\ude42 They appreciate the effort for stuff like this which is really nice.\nSo fun!! A few years ago, my twin sister put together a cookbook of all the recipes from our childhood years; we celebrated our birthday last week, and I made our whole birthday dinner from that cookbook! It\u2019s amazing how memories if food stay with us\u2013 I\u2019m sure your daughter will never forget this cake!\nWhat a wonderful idea! Very special.\nWhat a sweet cake\u2026love the flowers and butterfly as I\u2019m sure she did as well.\nDaughters are so~ precious. Happy Birthday to your 12 year old\u2026 I love purple too and she will love it! Fae.\nWhat a fabulous looking cake! Yes, my favourite colours are deep crimson and purple. Having said that, at your daughters age I had my bedroom painted purple walls and white accents\u2026put me right off purple for a while!\nHer room at her mother\u2019s house has purple walls so we\u2019ll see how long this lasts. At our house she still has the yellow as the main colour that her dad did years ago. I like the idea of purple with the white accents though. A great contrast.\nWell happy birthday! Wow!

    "text": "Starting XI Prediction: Solskjaer to keep 4-3-3 formation with Lingard, Rashford, and Martial leading the attack against PSG?\nManchester United return to UEFA Champions League action against Paris Saint-Germain at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. It is what the Theatre of Dreams is made for, European nights under the floodlights. Last season, United made it to the same stage of the competition, losing to Sevilla and exiting the competition. This season, under the management of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, things may go a bit different for the Red Devils. Confidence is high and United are undefeated in 11 matches, winning ten and drawing one.\nNow is perhaps the best time to face the French champions as Neymar is out of the match and striker, Edinson Cavani limped out of Saturday\u2019s 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. PSG are a competent team but playing in France, they do not really have much competition which may be a negative ahead of this game, as United have been challenged in every match they have played, showing the difference between the Premier League and French football.\nThe Spanish number one was rarely tested against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday but when he was, he was at his best. There are suggestions that the goalkeeper is calling for a \u00a3350,000 per week wage to sign a new contract at United, which is fair considering that he is the player who has been the difference for United \u2013 more often than not. He seems players like Alexis Sanchez on a high wage, yet in terms of what he offers United, De Gea offers so much more.\nUnited have managed to keep two clean sheets in their last two matches, which shows that some things have changed for United under Solskjaer. Ashley Young and Victor Lindelof were rested against Fulham, with the \u2018ice man\u2019 suffering from a knock. I expect both will be back against PSG with Luke Shaw keeping his place and Eric Bailly partnering Lindelof, which has seen both players in good form recently. Solskjaer has Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and possibly Marcos Rojo to select also, keeping options open.\nUnited\u2019s best midfield will be tested against PSG on Tuesday. Ander Herrera, Nemanja Matic, and Paul Pogba. Both Herrera and Matic allow Pogba to play further forward, which has seen the Frenchman play some good football recently, also seeing him score eight goals and five assists in his last ten matches under Solskjaer. This United midfield has the form, the ability and the experience to work the magic against PSG at the Theatre of Dreams.\nMarcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard were both rested in the 3-0 victory over Fulham at the weekend, meaning they will both be fresh to face PSG at Old Trafford. Anthony Martial played 70 minutes against Fulham, scoring a sublime goal, also getting an assist, which will mean his confidence will be high ahead of the Champions League match. These three, on their day, can be devastating to any team. If United manage to keep a clean sheet at home, the quarter-finals could be set for United this season.\nPreview: U23\u2019s out to fight for their futures against Reading?\nWhere did it all go wrong for Luke Shaw?",
