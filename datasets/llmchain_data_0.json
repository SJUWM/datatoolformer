He died at Salzburg, 27 November, 789. In 1233 he was canonized by Gregory IX. His doctrine that the earth is a sphere was derived from the teaching of ancient geographers, and his belief in the existence of the antipodes was probably influenced by the accounts which the ancient Irish voyagers gave of their journeys. This, at least, is the opinion of Rettberg (\"Kirchengesch. Deutschlands\", II, 236).",

Additionally, due to low earnings, fast food workers\u2019 families also receive an annual average of $1.04 billion in food stamp benefits and $1.91 billion in Earned Income Tax Credit payments.\nThe ten largest fast-food companies alone made more than $7.4 billion in profits in 2012 and paid their top executives more than $53 million in compensation.\nLow-wage fast-food jobs cost tax-payers the most in California ($717 million), New York ($708 million), Texas ($556 million), Illinois ($368 million), and Florida ($348 million).\nAccording to Super Sizing Public Costs, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s represents the most costly fast-food company for tax-payers.\u201d Low wages and lack of benefits at McDonald\u2019s cost tax-payers \u201c$1.2 billion every year in public assistance programs,\u201d according to the report.\nYUM! Brands (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC), Subway, Burger King and Wendy\u2019s round-out the top five fast-food companies with workers who rely on public assistance.\nThe median average wage for fast-food workers is $8.69; an estimated 87 percent of fast-food workers do not receive health benefits. Furthermore, 67 percent of front-line fast-food workers are adults 20 and older; 68 percent are the main earners in their families and more than one-quarter are raising children.\n\u201cThis business model puts tax-payers on the hook, while rewarding corporate CEO\u2019s,\u201d Jack Temple, a policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project and co-author of Super Sizing Public Costs, said during a conference call with the press on October 15.\nThe reports come on the heels of a nation-wide wave of fast-food worker strikes; most recently strikes took place in over 60 cities across the nation with thousands of fast-food workers walking off their jobs.\n\u201cThe CEO of McDonald\u2019s makes more in a day than I make in a year,\u201d Yates added.\nFast-food workers nationally are calling for $15 an-hour in pay and the right to form or join a union without retaliation.\nJacobs also addressed the wave of non-traditional worker organizing taking place in fast-food, retail and other low-wage service sector jobs.\nSuper Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill was published by the National Employment Law Project and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry was published by the University of California Labor Center.",

The March incident cost him a two-game suspension, but when TMZ released the video showing the act, the Ravens terminated his contract and the NFL suspended him indefinitely.\nToday I captured the seriousness of domestic violence. The report from the Violence Policy Center shows that South Carolina is ranked the second worst state in the nation for violence against women. The report notes that 50 women were killed in 2012.

    "text": "Ford is building cars that \"talk\" with traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians.\nAt CES 2019 in Las Vegas on Monday, the automaker announced plans to start selling cars that feature this type of technology in 2022.\nThe technology, called cellular vehicle-to-everything (or C-V2X for short), uses wireless signals to share road data, such as a car's location or the color of a traffic light, with other vehicles.\nFord believes it will make cities safer by better informing drivers of their surroundings, and compares the innovation to the invention of the traffic light in the 19th century.\n\"The world's first traffic light [helped] people move through a congested London intersection that had become dangerous for pedestrians due to the popularity of horse-drawn carriages,\" Don Butler, executive director of Ford Connected Vehicle Platform and Product, wrote in a Medium post. \"At Ford, 150 years later, we are excited to continue advancing this type of thinking.\"\nBut critics says the cost of installing the technology will be burdensome for cash-strapped governments. Corinne Kisner, deputy director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, called the expense of installing and maintaining vehicle-to-everything technology a major concern. Many municipalities struggle to fill their potholes, let alone install smart city technology. She also described any effort to require a pedestrian to carry a smartphone to guarantee safety as a dangerous paradigm shift.\n\"It's an unreasonable burden to ask or require people walking in their streets and cities and in front of their homes to carry a signal transmitting device,\" Kisner said. \"The burden needs to be on the driver of the two-ton vehicle, whether it's a human or autonomous technology.\"\nFord sees things differently. Butler described to CNN Business the example of a pedestrian walking on a dirt road who might be identified by a car with C-V2X because they were carrying a smartphone. Traditionally, a driver would rely on their headlights to see the pedestrian. But Butler stops short of expecting smartphones to be recommended or required for pedestrians.\n\"It's like the question of will people be permitted to drive once autonomous vehicles become prevalent,\" Butler said. \"That's something we can only speculate about.\"\nFord isn't the first company to explore outfitting pedestrians with sensors. Siemens, the German conglomerate, began a US Department of Transportation pilot test in Tampa, Florida, last year using pedestrians' smartphones to communicate their location to vehicles. But Siemens officials found the smartphone location data to be so inaccurate that it wasn't useful.\nThe pilot was reworked to focus on outfitting 1,000 vehicles with sensors, and notifying drivers of nearby vehicles with audio alerts, according to Dave Miller, the head of connected vehicles at Siemens.\nBicycling advocates also argued it was unrealistic to require someone to carry a phone on roads.\n\"We think the way things are headed, what we need is more smart sensors [built] in the roadway, or infrastructure,\" Miller told CNN Business.\nThis is something Ford wants, too. It sees the coming arrival of 5G networks -- the next-generation of internet speed -- as a chance to install vehicle-to-everything technology throughout cities.\n\"We think there's an opportunity for a win-win that helps offset to a significant degree the cost a city might have to otherwise undertake to deploy this infrastructure,\" Butler said.\nFord is urging other automakers to install C-V2X in their vehicles.\nBut there's a long road ahead for Ford to make C-V2X as widespread as the traffic light, which took decades to be popularized.",

The company also owns other health care facilities including home health care and nursing homes.\nIn a news release, the company said the restructuring is needed because of changes in the way health care is provided, the economy and health reform. These factors are affecting health care organizations in Michigan and nationwide, the news release stated.\nThe health system has a work force of 4,831. Officials will not know the number of employees who could lose their jobs until the restructuring is completed in mid-May. But it is expected to be less than 1 percent of all employees.\nCompany officials said these changes are happening just as demand for health care services is increasing in some areas and decreasing in others. Growing areas include physician practices, emergency services and critical care. In the past nine months, MidMichigan has added 50 new physicians and what the company calls mid-level providers. New positions include primary-care providers, specialists and a new critical care team.\n\"MidMichigan's vision is to be an integrated health system, and we have been working toward that vision for more than three years,\" said Richard M. Reynolds, president of MidMichigan Health. \"With changes in the health care environment and declining reimbursement we are challenged to shift our resources and realign our employees to continue to provide excellent clinical quality and excellent patient experiences in a safe environment. Doing that means that we have to change and re-tool how we do things.\"\nDeveloping new physician practices requires clinical and support staff. As a result, MidMichigan Health plans to take staff members from under-utilized areas and put them in open positions. Some people could lose their jobs, the company said, because they cannot be redeployed into open positions.\nManagement of some departments throughout the four hospitals will be re-aligned, and some services will be consolidated, the news release said.\n\"Our business is changing,\" said Lynn Bruchhof, MidMichigan Health vice president of human resources. \"We are fortunate to be able to realign our talent resources, our people, to areas of growth and need throughout MidMichigan Health.\"\nSome employees will retire, while others are volunteering to take part-time positions, and still others are applying for the 120 open positions in MidMichigan Health, she said.",

The ocelot is a vulnerable creature, susceptible to habitat changes like roads, agriculture, housing developments and trapping. There may be fewer than 100 left in southern United States.\nConcerns that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is making the plight of these 'dwarf leopards' worse led the Animal Welfare Institute and WildEarth Guardians to take legal action against the USDA's Wildlife Services program. They are suing Wildlife Services for \"failing to ensure that it is not harming ocelots.\"\nWildlife Services describes itself as a program that resolves human - wildlife conflicts so people can \"co-exist\" with nature, but often, their solution to wildlife problems involves traps and cyanide capsules. They use these methods to deal with predators that are bothering farmers, but The Animal Welfare Institute and WildEarth Guardians say ocelots are getting caught in the cross-fire, killed by methods that can't tell the difference between an ocelot and a fox.\n\"Wildlife Services routinely fails to comply with federal laws like the Endangered Species Act,\" said Tara Zuardo, wildlife attorney with the Animal Welfare Institute in a press release. \"Few ocelots remain in the United States and they require basic protection to ensure that they are not killed by the devices\u2014such as steel-jaw leghold traps and cyanide capsules\u2014Wildlife Services indiscriminately uses on public lands to kill wildlife.\"\nThis is not the first time the methods of Wildlife Services have been criticised. This June, the Washington Post reported it had killed more than 4 million animals through poisoning, snaring and shooting in 2013 alone.\nBut from year to year, the number of animals killed by the program fluctuates significantly, from 1.5 to 5 million. In 2008, 5 million animals were killed while over the next four years it was 3 million.The number is not rising, as Wildlife Services suggests, causing critics to question their justification for their methods.\nSo far, their secretive approach has gone relatively unnoticed. Now, the Animal Welfare Institute and WildEarth Guardians are trying to change that.",

This donation was part of a project jointly initiated by the National Centre of Manuscripts and ProCredit Bank, in which the Bank bought a unique collection of ex librises from a private individual living in Thessaloniki, Greece.\nMany of the graphic images on the ex librises were the work of Georgian painters, so their donation to the National Centre of Manuscripts is a very important contribution to preserving the heritage of Georgian manuscripts. They carry additional information about the life and creative work of Georgia\u2019s artists and important public figures.\n\u201cFrom ProCredit Bank\u2019s side we are extremely delighted to have had the chance to support Georgia\u2019s culture and inheritance of manuscripts. It\u2019s extremely rewarding to have had the chance to hand over this unique and interesting collection of ex librises to the National Centre of Manuscripts; that we had the opportunity to obtain these very interesting examples of Georgian culture and history. By handing this collection today to the National Centre of Manuscripts we also, one more time, want to demonstrate our support for the development of Georgian culture. All in all I think it\u2019s a very promising beginning for a hopefully fruitful and long-lasting relationship with the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\n\u201cIn the National Centre of Manuscripts there are manuscripts, historical documents, archival materials and library collections. This is one of the largest collections across the country. It has been gathering material and growing since the 19th century; this process is still ongoing and will never be finished. The collection has mainly grown from people\u2019s donations, except for a few exceptions. Over the years we received donations from individuals, families, from private companies, public and private organizations. And the result is a unique collection which is now protected by the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d he added.\n\u201cToday, one of the priorities for us is searching for new materials and continuing the pursuit of our great ancestors, who began collecting such materials in the 19th century. We also have another sub-priority, as just like this material was found in a foreign country, great care is needed not to lose Georgia-related materials that may be located abroad. They shouldn\u2019t fall into someone else\u2019s hands, in some cases private collectors. Then the trace will be lost,\u201d Buba Kudava said.\n\u201cWe were searching over the internet with our colleagues for information of this sort, and we managed to connect with an individual in Thessaloniki, Greece. We asked them to send us information on a regular basis about Georgia-related materials. And indeed they sent us the ex libris collection and when we showed this material to experts, it turned out to be very interesting. There are many famous figures associated with these ex librises. On the one hand, one part of this collection was designed by well-known artists. The second part is known because it is created for famous statesmen, but by a lesser-known Georgian painter. The first is the Elene Akhvlediani ex libris, the second is the Sergo Kobuladze ex libris. We did not have a separate collection of ex librises until now. Of course there are such materials in archives and in books, but so far we have not had such an amount of ex librises,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEx librises were invented along with book printing and were an integral part of a book through the ages. Today, some of them are considered works of art. That is why participation in such a project is very important for ProCredit Bank, and we are very pleased that this unique ex libris collection has been added to the heritage of Georgian manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\nThe term \u201cex libris\u201d is Latin for \u201cfrom the library of\u201d, and is used to describe a printed label on the inside front cover of a book indicating the name of the owner. In the past, ex librises often took the form of a drawing, an emblem or an illustration of some famous event, sometimes by a famous artist.",

In an earlier call Wednesday, De Cambra had said that the governor was still undecided.\nThe bill \u2014 HB-1119, sponsored by Democratic Denver Rep.

As it stands, the Denver Police Department is the only Colorado law enforcement agency that consistently releases comprehensive information following internal investigations.\nThe bill passed the House and Senate and has been sitting on the governor\u2019s desk for about a week, awaiting the final signature needed to make HB-1119 state law.\nUpon learning Polis was not necessarily on board with the bill, the Colorado Press Association \u2014 one of the primary backers of the bill \u2014 sent out an email to its members that called the situation \u201curgent\u201d and implored journalists and editorial boards to speak out now in support of HB-1119.\nMedia in the state have heralded the bill as a key step toward transparency from an institution that shrouds much of its accountability system in secrecy.

    "text": "Jan. 22 will be here before agencies know it. So will Feb. 6. Here\u2019s betting that even April 16 will be here seemingly tomorrow.\nThose are the 45-day, 60-day and 120-day deadlines folded into the Open Government Directive, issued by the White House last month. The first, which arrives soon, is when every federal agency must identify and publish online at least three high-value datasets it plans to make available to the public.\nFifteen days after that, each agency must launch an open-government Web page that is ready to be updated in a timely fashion. By April 16, each agency must unveil an open-government plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities.\nThose are tall orders in short times, to be sure. However, most agencies haven't devised an open-government plan, decided what data is high value or figured out how to share it with the public. The directive is a sweeping mandate designed to transform the way the federal government interacts with the public, yet even its White House authors say each agency is essentially moving through this territory on its own without a road map.\nAgencies have few choices for figuring out how to comply with the directive. They can go it alone and create a plan that they hope makes the grade. Perhaps some will join forces or find industry partners that might guide them to a successful outcome. Or, counting on the kindness of strangers in the White House, they can rely on promised support from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where the authors of the directive live.\nBut even though the vagueness of the directive is a challenge, most agencies agree that it could be worse. Flexibility is better than getting strict and possibly draconian requirements that don\u2019t account for agencies' special needs and different missions. For example, the way NASA shares images of the surface of Mars needs to be different than the way the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shares airline flight delay data.\nThe two men behind the directive are federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra and Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra. By the Feb. 6 deadline, they are supposed to establish a dashboard on WhiteHouse.gov that will aggregate statistics and visualizations so the public can see how various agencies are doing.\nThe goal of the dashboard is not to highlight agencies\u2019 failures, Chopra said.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that new efforts in public engagement will be an evolution of older programs. For example, the General Services Administration published 12 years' worth of Federal Advisory Committee data onto Data.gov the day after the directive was announced.\nDavid McClure, associate administrator of GSA\u2019s Office of Citizen Services and Communications, suggests that agencies take a close look at whom they serve and then provide data that will be the most valuable to people.\nBut with the directive\u2019s deadlines fast approaching, it\u2019s not clear if all, much less many, agencies will be able to demonstrate the early goals of openness and transparency. After all, the memo issued by President Barack Obama that got all this whole thing rolling called for the directive to be published by late May 2009. It ended up being released Dec. 8, which shows that creating a transparent government isn\u2019t a see-through process.",

The new government will have to work around this in order to enhance growth measures and reduce austerity levels because austerity on top of austerity will not do the trick. If you keep milking a cow without feeding it you are not going to end up with the desired results.\"\nDespite reservations over Greece's ability to deliver on austerity measures, eurozone finance ministers have given Athens billions of euros to rescue the country from its financial woes.\nReacting to the second tranche of the bailout, Lucas Papademos, the Greek prime minister, described the day as a historic one for the Greek economy.\n\"With today's decisions, we are given an opportunity to move towards more stable conditions, to reduce the uncertainty which has affected the economic activity and enhance confidence in the prospects of the Greek economy,\" he said.\n\"In this way, the adjustment process of the economy can be facilitated and also better conditions for its recovery can be provided and new jobs can be created.\"\nBut some financial experts argue that once again the can has been kicked down the road to be dealt with later.\nThe conditions of the second bailout include $399m cutbacks in military spending, a $40m saving by reducing staff numbers in central government, and reducing the minimum wage, as well as slashing overtime pay for doctors in public hospitals by at least $66m.\nWhat this means is further budget cuts which are already deeply unpopular with the Greek people who have continuously opposed harsh austerity measures imposed following the first bailout in 2010.\n\"The political system has very low credibility and in order to proceed with these tough measures you need to have credible political personnel, which we are lacking right now. Hopefully there will be an inflow of new people from the private sector. There is a huge debate as to whether the major parties will survive this economic crisis.\"\nAs before, eurozone finance ministers say they want assurances Greece will stick to its promises.\nTheir comments were backed by the contents of a leaked report from the European Commission, the Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nThe report predicts that Greek debt could stay at a staggering 160 per cent of the country's GDP by 2020, unless drastic changes are made.\nCritics say the new measures to bail out struggling countries have to be matched by economic reforms.\nJan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, said: \"When you look at the derailments in Greece which have occurred several times now, it is probably necessary that there is some kind of permanent presence of the troika in Athens, not every three months, but more on a permanent basis. I am in favour of that.\"\nSo why should this bailout work when a previous one has failed, and in accepting the stringent conditions attached, has Greece surrendered control of its own economy?\nTo what extent will this second bailout rescue Greece's shattered economy, at what cost and how is this going to impact Greece's internal politics?\nJoining presenter Mike Hanna on Inside Story are guests: Fokion Zaimis, a small business owner and the CEO of Science Park; Vicky Pryce, a Greek-born economist and the former joint head of the UK government economic service; and Constantine Michalos, an economist and president of the Athens chamber of commerce and industry.\n\"There is already an EU task force here and they are trying to make sure that the various ministries that are important to the economy do the right thing. But there is a concern that actually some of that money will never be spent, it won't be spent correctly, it won't be value for money and it won't benefit the economy.\"\nFinance ministers meeting in Brussels approve $170bn rescue package needed to avoid default by debt-ridden nation.",

    "text": "President Barack Obama shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office last Thursday, after the two met to discuss the presidential transition.\nDonald Trump's victory in the race for the White House leaves widespread uncertainty about what's in store for public schools under the first Republican administration in eight years. Aside from school choice, Trump, a New York-based real estate developer who has never before held public office, spent little time talking about K-12 education during his campaign. And he has no record to speak of on the issue for insights into what he may propose.\n\"We're all engaging in a lot of speculation because there hasn't been a lot of serious discussion about this, especially in the Trump campaign,\" Martin R. West, an associate professor of education at Harvard University, said in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election. West has advised Republicans, including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, on education.\nTrump did propose a $20 billion plan to dramatically expand school choice for low-income students. It would use federal money to help them attend private, charter, magnet, and regular public schools of their choice. It's also designed to leverage additional state investments in school choice of up to $100 billion nationwide.\nIn the campaign, the president-elect also embraced merit pay for teachers, without offering details beyond saying he found it unfair that \"bad\" teachers sometimes earned \"more than the good ones.\" And, on the early-childhood front, he's pitched offering six weeks of maternity leave to women who do not get it through their employers, expanding the availability of dependent-care savings accounts, and offering tax incentives for employers to provide on-site day care.\nBut otherwise, the Trump campaign mostly dealt in sound bites with such controversial issues as the Common Core State Standards, the possibility of getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education, and gun-free school zones.\n\"I could really see him trying to minimize any role [of the federal government in education],\" Nat Malkus, a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in contemplating the implications of a Trump presidency ahead of the vote.\nWhile education is not a high-profile issue politically at the moment, it's not as if the Trump administration won't have anything to do on school policy.\nAt or near the top of the K-12 to-do list is how the new administration handles the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, the latest version of the flagship federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act that was first passed in 1965. The Education Department under President Barack Obama is relatively close to finalizing ESSA regulations governing how states hold schools accountable and how districts must show they are using federal money to supplement their state and local school budgets.\nRepublicans in Congress have been critical of both sets of proposals from the department, particularly the one governing the supplemental-money rule. In fact, 25 GOP lawmakers recently asked the department to rescind its proposal for ensuring federal funds are supplemental, not a replacement for state and local money, on the grounds that the proposal would give the department too much power over state and local budget decisions.\nThe incoming administration may be on the same page as those lawmakers, said Gerard Robinson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former state schools chief in Virginia and Florida.\n\"I think [Trump's] secretary of education will handle it differently than what we've seen from [current Secretary] John King,\" regarding the so-called supplement-not-supplant rules, Robinson said. Robinson is serving as a member of the Trump transition team, but spoke only on his own behalf.\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton focused more on early education and college affordability than K-12 in her losing bid for the White House.\nHowever, when it comes to ESSA in general, Robinson said he believes that Trump views the law as a result of a \"bipartisan coalition\" and that the president-elect won't get too heavily involved in ESSA's rollout.\nAnd Robinson expects states to have a great deal of flexibility in the ESSA accountability plans that they submit to the Trump administration starting next year\u2014significantly more than they enjoyed under Obama-era waivers from the No Child Left Behind Act, the predecessor to ESSA.\n\"This is a great time to be a state chief,\" Robinson said, adding at the same time that \"I don't want state chiefs to think that when they turn those [plans] in that, 'Oh, well, these will just get approved.' \"\nWhat's more, a lot of policies under the No Child Left Behind Act were part of the law but the George W. Bush or Obama administration didn't do much to enforce them. A couple of examples: the requirement that highly qualified teachers be distributed fairly between poor and less-poor schools, and that districts offer free tutoring to students in schools that weren't making progress under the law.\nThere could be similar examples of provisions that are on the books in ESSA, or in the Obama administration's regulations for the law, said Vic Klatt, a one-time aide to House Republicans who is now a principal at the Penn Hill Group. And since the Trump administration will be the first to enforce ESSA, it could be \"easier and less disruptive\" for it to simply ignore parts of the law than it would be for another administration down the line, Klatt said.\nTrump could also discard another key piece of the Obama education legacy: The president-elect could significantly curb the role of the department's office for civil rights when it comes to state and local policies, according to Robinson, and thereby return the OCR's role more to how it operated under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. That could have a big impact on everything from action on racial disparities in school discipline to transgender students' rights.\nRobinson also said that he expects the OCR to ensure that students' rights are not \"trampled on.\"\nSome civil rights advocates though, are already concerned, given some of Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric on Muslims and Latinos, that the office won't flex its enforcement muscles.\n\"We're worried,\" said Liz King, the director of education policy for the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"We're hearing what everyone else is hearing from teachers and families that kids don't feel safe.\"\nMuch depends on whom Trump picks to lead his Education Department\u2014assuming that he decides not to seek elimination or drastic cutbacks to the agency, which he has sometimes said he would like to do.\nIn October, Carl Palladino, a school board member in Buffalo, N.Y., and a Trump campaign surrogate, said he believed that if elected, Trump would pick someone from outside the education policy world to lead the department.\nAnother critical decision will be on who reviews states' proposed accountability plans for ESSA next year.\n\"Who are going to be his people? If he brings in a traditional right-of-center group, you can take it from there,\" said Maria Ferguson, the executive director of the Center on Education Policy, who worked in the Education Department under President Bill Clinton.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks at his victory rally on Nov. 9 in New York City. The Republican real estate developer made school choice a key theme when talking about public education on the campaign trail.\nFerguson suggested a traditional conservative policy agenda of expanded charter schools and other initiatives would probably get traction under Trump.\n\"All these familiar themes that the right-of-center groups have talked about will become a version of his agenda,\" Ferguson predicted. She mentioned school choice and groups like the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which was founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination. \"But I don't think it's going to come from him.\"\nEarlier this year, Trump tapped Rob Goad, a staffer for Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., to be his education adviser, not long before the Trump campaign released its $20 billion school choice plan. There are some basic similarities between Trump's plan and a push last year to make federal Title I aid \"portable\" for disadvantaged students to use at both public and private schools.\nAnd Trump's transition team for education includes Robinson, the former Florida and Virginia state chief, and Williamson M. Evers, a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, who worked at the Education Department under President George W. Bush.\nMuch also depends on Trump's relationship with Congress and to what extent he empowers key GOP lawmakers on education policy.\nBesides ESSA, Congress has been fairly active in moving education-related legislation. In recent months, for example, the House of Representatives approved reauthorizations of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.\nSome, but less, progress has also been made on renewing the Child Nutrition Act. And the Higher Education Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Head Start federal preschool program are up for reauthorization in the near future.\nTrump has outlined a general plan on college affordability, including capping student-loan repayments at 12.5 percent of income and instituting loan forgiveness after 15 years for certain borrowers. College affordability is a more prominent issue thanks to the 2016 presidential campaign. And since Congress remains sharply divided along partisan lines, Trump and the Republicans likely won't be able to simply roll ahead with all their preferences on higher education.\n\"You're not doing anything legislatively without bipartisan support,\" said West, of Harvard. \"It's not obvious to me that there is a clear Republican agenda in Congress right now with respect to K-12 education, except for trying to ensure that ESSA is implemented in a way consistent with the intent of the law of empowering states to design accountability systems as they see fit.\"\nBut uncertainty prevails, both over what the new president will take an interest in and how much he will push to get education bills and initiatives over the finish line.",

(WLFI) \u2014 Wildlife rehibilators said 88 more pigeons were found at an I-65 rest stop where 57 others were dumped in December.\n\"It's a crazy situation,\" said Kim Hoover with Hoots to Howls Wildlife Rehabilitation.\nHoover was notified of the dumping on Feb. 28. An attendant at the White County rest stop on northbound I-65 called her. Hoover said nine boxes, identical to those found in December, were filled with pigeons in a dumpster. Four of the 88 pigeons were found dead, Hoover said.\nThe discovery now makes 145 pigeons found dumped in the same dumpster. Indiana State Police recovered 57 pigeons on Dec. 10. Hoover never thought she would see another situation like this again.\n\"I thought it was a rare act, never happen again, once in a lifetime as heart wrenching as it was then it happens two months later and you're like really?\" she said.\nUnlike the December discovery where the birds were buried in the dumpster, this flock was found on top of trash. Hoover said likely, they were dumped overnight between Feb. 27 and Feb. 28.\n\"They're gorgeous birds,\" said Hoover. \"These are some of the prettiest pigeons I've ever seen. It just stinks.\"\nShe said pigeon enthusiasts reached out to her and helped fill in some of the blanks. The pigeons found in the dumpster are Parlor Roller pigeons. They are bred for their ability to somersault on the ground. People roll them on the ground in competitions to see how far they can go. Click here and go to the 3:03 minute mark to see these rolling birds in action.\nThere are pigeon clubs who compete with these birds humanely, but Hoover believes these dumpster pigeons were part of an illegal gambling ring and were abused. She said both times she came to resuce the birds, they had parasites on them and the boxes they were in did not have breathing holes.\n\"There's a lot of money being made and I am told that this fellow could care less about fines because he knows they won't get in trouble,\" she said.\nHoover said the birds found recently had the same tags on them as the ones found in December. The tags had the name and phone number of a Dublin, Ohio man. News 18 attempted to make calls to the number provided and it has been disconnected. The fact that the man is located out of state is causing problems for who is responsible to help.\n\"The animal control of Dublin Ohio which is where they come from say they were dumped in Indiana and Indiana is like well they came from Ohio,\" said Hoover.\nHoover said she is worried that this has happened at this rest stop other times but unfortunately, those birds were not found in time. She suggested the rest stop get security cameras, but found out that the state won't fund it.\nWildlife centers in Valparaiso and Illinois took a majority of the birds from Hoover. She has 11 left in her care. She said she has received offers of help from other people as well, which she is thankful for. So what's next for the birds?\n\"They have got to get their health up and hopefully then adopted out,\" she said. \"They are trying to find people who understand the birds and you don't want them to go back into the same situation they came from.\"",

    "text": "SPOILER ALERT: Before you read this post, roast yourself a nice pig, pour yourself a bottle of wine (I suggest a fruity grenache with the pork), cork the bottle extremely tightly and watch last night\u2019s Lost.\nWe can spend all day talking about the mythology and background revealed on \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d an intense episode of Lost\u2013and I\u2019m sure we will\u2013but let\u2019s say this first: fancy story aside, last night showed us a fine hour of acting, plain and simple.\nI\u2019ve seen Nestor Carbonell in a variety of roles on TV (from Bat Manuel in The Tick to the CBS soap Cane), and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been a slouch as Richard on Lost. But until this season, he\u2019s had to play Richard on a single, subdued, sustained note of enigmatic cool. In \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d he almost literally made Richard into another character, showing us the decent, desperate, heartbroken man who would be transformed over 140 years as Jacob\u2019s ambassador on the Island.\nIt may have seemed like a lot of time spent to some viewers, but clearly Cuse and Lindelof thought they needed to show, not just tell, the circumstances that brought Richard to his current pass. And Carbonell sold it, embodied Ricardo\u2019s horror as he lived through a Victorian-horror melodrama. Which is important, because they had to place us in the mindset of someone who believes, literally not figuratively, that he is actually in hell.\nSo are they in hell? (That, and Purgatory, were among the first theories fans spun about Lost.) Are they actually in danger, as Ghost Isabella says, of going to hell? No, but Ricardo has come to what he thinks of as hell, and to a place that someone of his era and mindset will naturally interpret as hell. Unlike, say, Hurley, a religious, penitent man living on the Canary Islands in 1867 has not read sci-fi or seen a monster movie in his life. If he ends up in a place where he sees horrors, where the dead come to life (and are seemingly killed again), and a thing made of smoke snatches men up to their death\u2014well, that\u2019s hell, case closed. Someone of another era will give it a different name.\nIt\u2019s not hell\u2013right?\u2013but it is, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d told us more explicitly than ever, a metaphysical playing ground, where two forces are battling it out through human subjects, not unlike gods in Greek mythology. So what game are Jacob and Smokey/The Man in Black playing? We got the rough outline at the end of season 5\u2013and fans have inferred or theorized most of the rest\u2013but it was still a bit stunning to hear Jacob say it to Ricardo directly.\nTo wit: Smokey is imprisoned on the Island. He is a malevolent force\u2013call him evil, call him hatred, call him the devil if you want\u2013who, if released, would spread over the world like, well, black smoke. (Or wine. I like the idea of a Wine Monster.) Jacob brings people to the Island, where\u2013whatever they have done in the past\u2013they have a chance to choose good over evil. (He is, metaphorically, the producer of Lost.) Jacob believes people can choose good. Smokey believes (as he said in the season 5 finale) that they always go bad in the end. Smokey tries to manipulate and tempt them toward that end; Jacob believes they must choose of their own free will.\nSo far, so God-and-Devily. But what is \u201cright and wrong\u201d in the endgame of Lost, anyway? I\u2019m glad, if this is the case, that the arc of the series is the characters\u2019 redemption, and that they have agency to choose for themselves. Still, is their goodness going to be defined by which side they pick in this Island-god showdown? Why exactly, is it \u201cgood\u201d to pick the jackass deity who strands innocent people in an Island hellhole over the jackass deity who deceives and or kills them once they get there? It\u2019s better, maybe, but I\u2019m not sure Jacob\u2019s role in all this seems so holy. You crashed me on this terrifying rock so you could \u201cprove [Smokey] wrong?\u201d Have a freaking debate society and leave me out of it!\nIn any event, from \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d the notion of the Losties finally saying pox-on-both-your-houses and rejecting the whole cosmic game seems less likely. Though I still see signs that Smokey and Jacob may be more alike than they let on: it was certainly interesting to see that, when Smokey tried to enlist Ricardo to kill Jacob, he gave him the knife and the same speech that Dogen (not Jacob, but his servant) gave Sayid to get him to kill Smokey.\nAs all this unfolds, I hope that the other conflicts over the Island built over the last five seasons\u2013the \u201cscience-based\u201d story, if you will\u2013aren\u2019t wholly subsumed in the Paradise Lost scenario. How does Hanso, and his descendants in the Hanso foundation, figure into all this? Why did they come to see the Island as significant, and what exactly did Dharma want to achieve on the Island? How did Widmore get there in the first place, and what did he want\u2013and what investment, if any, do Smokey and Jacob have in his war with Ben, and vice versa? The closer I get to the center of the onion, the more I want to revisit the layers.\nThose are all big-picture questions that (I will be a broken record here) are impossible to judge until the season and series are over. As an episode, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d again proved Lost\u2019s ability to find the humanity in, and build a connection with, its most seemingly enigmatic characters. Hell of a job.\n* Is it just me, or did Titus Welliver get direction to deliver his lines like Terry O\u2019Quinn\u2014or, specifically, as O\u2019Quinn-as-Smokey-as-Locke? Whether intentional or coincidental, Welliver\u2019s phrasing and manner made clear he and O\u2019Quinn were playing the same character in different bodies. Nice work.\n* So if Smokey gets off The Island, the world will become plagued with evil, hatred and malevolence. As opposed to\u2026?\n* And about Jacob: did he strike anyone else in the 1867 part of this story as more tough and hard-assed than we\u2019ve seen him in the Island\u2019s present? A bit of an Old Testament Jacob?\n* I\u2019ve been reading elsewhere about the parallels between the plot on the Island and Stephen King\u2019s novels, especially The Stand, which at this point I am glad I haven\u2019t read. But when the Man in Black took out the magic weapon and told Ricardo to kill his enemy, was I the only one reminded of HBO\u2019s Carniv\u00e0le, and the murderous eternal war among the avatars?\n* When Ricardo saw Isabella in the hold of The Black Rock, the inference was that this was actually Smokey appearing as Isabella to manipulate him. Presumably Smokey had access to Ricardo\u2019s memories after examining and flash-photographing him, yes? I could look this up but I\u2019m not going to: is this the first time we\u2019ve seen Smokey manifest as a person who (unlike Locke, Yemi or Christian) had not physically been on the Island, even as a corpse?\n* That CGI butterfly that fluttered into the Black Rock\u2019s hold\u2013I assume it\u2019s significant, and I have no explanation for it. (My one theory, that the Island is actually Pandora from Avatar, is probably not too likely.) Speaking of CGI, credit to Lost for showing some scenes set on the ocean that did not look like a low-budget video game.\n* OK, this may be immature, but was anyone else wondering if Hurley and Richard were going to share a kiss, a la Ghost, when Ricardo was visited by the shade of Isabella? It would have blown the moment, I suppose, but still.\n* More seriously, when Isabella told Richard he\u2019d suffered enough, were you thinking he was going to die? More to the point, were you, like me, hoping he would die, as a mercy to him? It\u2019s a tribute to the show that it can cause a reaction like this to a character we\u2019ve long known as one of the bad guys\u2013or so, at least, we thought.",

While its initial objective was to serve its global clients having Chinese operations, the company has now started addressing the regional and local market. Currently, it has 1,300 employees working in China. In its latest annual report, TCS said its China operations had managed to break even.\nAccording to Girija Pande, executive vice-president and head of Asia Pacific division at TCS, the Chinese IT market is growing by at least 20% annually and revenue from the company\u2019s Chinese operations will grow by around 45% in the next two years.\n\u201cIn the short term, we will be expanding our presence and increasing the headcount to at least 5,000 by 2011,\" said Pande.\nSimilarly, Infosys has a 1,000-strong workforce in China and said it is in expansion mode. \u201cWe have expanded our operations in two cities Shanghai and Hangzhou,\" a company spokesperson said in an email response. The company\u2019s Chinese subsidiaries, however, were still loss-making as on 30 September, according to the company\u2019s second quarter results.\nSatyam admitted it is yet to make significant headway with its China operations but said it is in expansion mode with an eye on the long-term.\nThe company currently employs around 1,000 people in its two subsidiaries in China and plans to scale up headcount to nearly 2,000 by 2010. It is also investing in a training centre in China, which will have a capacity of at least 2,500 by 2010.\n\u201cIt is still a mystery why Indian companies have not been able to get any significant share of outsourced work from China and Japan,\" said Virender Aggarwal, head of rest of the world operations for Satyam.\nAnalysts acknowledge that China has been a rather difficult market for a variety of reasons.\n\u201cSo far, the Chinese domestic market has been one that is difficult to engage, primarily because of state and public sector dominance,\" said Milan Sheth, partner and head of IT outsourcing advisory at audit and consulting firm Ernst and Young. \u201cIt is critical to have a well connected and established Chinese local partner who can help penetrate that market,\" he said.\nTCS said it views China as a better base to address the Japanese market. \u201cA significant share of outsourced work from the Japanese market is cornered by Chinese companies, as they have a relative cultural and linguistic advantage over their Indian counterparts. We see being present in China as the first step in building the right relationships,\" said Pande.\nBoth TCS and Satyam are betting on local talent to succeed in their Chinese operations and help the company better address the local market as well as help build bridges with Japanese companies. At least 90% of TCS\u2019 workforce in China comprises local hires.\nNasscom\u2019s Som Mittal said that the size of the Japanese IT market and the potential for outsourcing presents a huge opportunity for Indian IT firms, but, he added that the market has been relatively insulated due to language and cultural barriers. \u201cHowever, we see an increasing desire among Japanese companies for sourcing competitively priced IT services from foreign companies. More importantly, the factors limiting market penetration by Indian companies are being recognized and addressed by the Japanese themselves.\"\nNasscom has set up a Japan desk to explore ways for Indian IT companies to adapt themselves to compete more effectively in the Japanese market.\nBoth China and Japan are long-term plays, said experts.\n\u201cIt is very important for Indian IT companies to understand that investments in the Chinese market should be done with a long term view. Given the nature of that market, it is unrealistic to expect quick turnarounds,\" Sheth said.\nWipro and HCL did not respond to queries on their China and Japan strategy.",

Jerry Brown had insisted on having the reserve limit in the bill, which was a little surprising.\nIt not only defied common sense by potentially forcing local districts to spend down financial reserves against their will, but clearly violated Brown\u2019s own oft-voiced principles of \u201csubsidiarity\u201d \u2013 leaving decisions in local hands \u2013 and building reserves as prudent hedges.\nIt was clearly a sop to the powerful California Teachers Association and other unions which might have otherwise opposed Proposition 2, which was to be the focal point of Brown\u2019s re-election campaign.\nForcing districts to spend down reserves could potentially free money for salary negotiations. Thus, placing the reserve limit in SB 858 would, it appeared, persuade union leaders to not oppose Proposition 2\u2019s passage and give them cover vis-\u00e0-vis their own members \u2013 even though it\u2019s unlikely that conditions for invoking the limit will be met in the foreseeable future, and school officials could probably sidestep it with creative budget-writing.\nAs the Legislature reconvened this week, the California School Boards Association demanded repeal of the limit, citing a study saying it could force districts to spend as much as $17 billion, including emergency reserves, against their better judgment.\n\u201cThis is bad law and needs to be repealed,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Josephine Lucey, declared.\nIt may have been an acceptable tradeoff to Brown, ever the pragmatist willing to set aside even his principles when political exigencies intrude. But it\u2019s still bad public policy and he has dropped hints that with Proposition 2 now passed, he might entertain repealing or modifying it.\nHowever, a Brown flip-flop, if it happens, would make the whole episode look even more cynically manipulative and would also present a political dilemma for the unions.",

    "text": "The world of technology, particularly medical technology, tends to be consumed with making us superhuman. It wants to enhance our abilities and prolong our lives, if not enable us to live forever. But new innovations give rise to new and tough choices, and a small but growing group of startups sees it as their mission to use technology, not to extend life, but to help people make and document some of the most difficult decisions regarding the end of it.\nThe story of a patient from her days as a student at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine particularly haunts Azalea Kim, co-founder of the startup TrueNorth. A 60-year-old woman, who had terminal cancer, came to the emergency room one weekend evening in dire condition. Because of a complicated family situation, Kim said, she arrived alone, without any family member to serve as an advocate and describe the kind of care she would want.\nAlthough her medical record was overflowing with documentation, the doctors were unable to locate a health care proxy form that could also have provided guidance on the kind of procedures the woman would \u2013 and wouldn\u2019t \u2013 have wanted in her final days. So, Kim explained, the doctors slipped into default mode, administering intravenous therapy, sending her to a radiologist, considering a surgical intervention and providing all kinds of aggressive and potentially unwanted care.\nPartly motivated by that experience, Kim and two Harvard Business School classmates, Margaret Terry and Amy Flaster, launched TrueNorth. A recent graduate of the Healthbox startup accelerator in Boston, TrueNorth provides a free online service for patients to record their legal healthcare proxy (or power of attorney) and then share it with loved ones and healthcare providers.\nThe goal, the founders said, is for TrueNorth to encourage patients to tackle difficult end-of-life decisions and ultimately integrate with electronic medical record systems to make these forms available in the health and emergency contexts in which they\u2019re needed.\nA planning tool on MyDirectives prompts patients to indicate their preferences and values related to end-of-life care.\nAnd it\u2019s one of a handful of relatively new startups trying to use technology to help patients think through and share their end of life decisions. For example, along with TrueNorth, the Dallas-based MyDirectives exclusively offers support around health-related decisions, while startups Everplans and AfterSteps focus on medical planning services, along with a wider range of financial and legacy planning options.\nAccording to Kim, just 25 percent of patients have documented a health care proxy or living will. And, other estimates indicate that even when a document exists, it can\u2019t be located 35 percent of the time. These companies say their digital tools help ensure that patients\u2019 voices are heard when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable or can no longer speak for themselves.\nFor example, they can walk patients through their end-of-life prioritizes, enabling them to indicate that they most value being free from pain or not being a burden to their families. They also let patients specify the circumstances in which they\u2019d want life-sustaining treatment, like heart machines and dialysis.\nAnd their rise makes sense given the growth of the so-called \u201clongevity economy\u201d of services for the aging Baby Boomer demographic, increasing awareness among patients that they need to be more proactive about their health and the digitization of healthcare \u2014 not to mention major advances in medical technology.\nAs a study from the Pew Internet & American Life pointed out earlier this month, nearly 40 percent of American adults are caring for another adult or child with a serious illness. And, a big chunk of those adults are part of the workforce. According to MyDirectives, caregiving-related expenses cost employers $17 to $33 billion a year in lost productivity (canceled meetings, delayed product launches, etc.) and an additional $11 billion in healthcare costs because caregivers suffer from stress, depression and other conditions.\nFor end-of-life care companies, that means there\u2019s an opportunity in targeting employers with a service that lets them improve care for their employees while hopefully contributing to productivity. For health plans, the pitch is that these services could help them attract and retain customers. And, in an era of rising healthcare costs, these services could also reduce the number of unwanted and often expensive procedures \u2013 an amount some experts peg at $6 billion a year.\nThat this topic isn\u2019t exactly uplifting is not lost on these companies \u2013 Jeff Zucker, co-founder and CEO of MyDirectives acknowledged that many people don\u2019t realize the ramifications of not having end-of-life documentation or just don\u2019t want to deal with it. But he said his hope is that his company, which started its work in 2007 and launched its service last year, can help people think of end-of-life planning as a way to take control of their circumstances, minimize suffering and honor a person\u2019s life.\nImage by racorn via Shutterstock.\nAnother great use of technology \u2013 I was not aware of these end of life apps/software but they seem like they would be incredibly useful (providing all health care providers would have easy access to them, of course!).\nI am the manager of HealthWorks Collective, the healthcare website in the Social Media Today network. I would love to repost this article for our readers. We have a series on Health Start-Ups and I think this would be a great addition. I would create a profile for you on our site and credit you as author, and would also link the post back to the original on gigacom. Please let me know if this is OK.\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if there isn\u2019t a gray area that medical staff would consider intrusive or extreme and a family member would have considered it to be an option that may have extended the life of a loved one.\nDoes TrueNorth have an actual product available on the market right now? Plenty of nice problem statements on their site, but no screenshots or descriptions of the actual product. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m unclear as to whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something I could proactively use as a patient vs. something a doctor would advise me to use.\nDoes TrueNorth have an actual product available on the market right now?

    "text": "The controversial $3 billion corporate tax initiative Measure 97 went down in defeat, according to partial election returns Tuesday night.\nMeasure 97 was failing 58 percent to 42 percent as of 9:50 p.m.\nThe defeat follows a hard-fought campaign that broke Oregon's spending record for ballot initiatives and pitted business interests against the state's largest public employee unions.\nMeasure 97 would charge certain C corporations a 2.5 percent tax on their gross annual sales in Oregon above $25 million. The measure called for the state to spend the new revenue on education, health care and senior services.\nSupporters of Measure 97 were still figuring out how to respond Tuesday night. Ben Unger, executive director of the union-affiliated group Our Oregon which backed the measure, suggested a different tax proposal might have fared better with voters. \"Clearly, we learned the tonight that the details weren't right,\" Unger said. However, when a reporter asked if the tax rate proposed in Measure 97 was too high, Unger said \"I would be surprised if you talked to very many voters that found that that was the problem.\"\nPat McCormick, a spokesman for the campaign to defeat the tax, said Measure 97 \"fell of its own weight when people understood what it would do\" and now it's up to state officials to come up with proposals to balance the state budget. \"The business community does have members that are very much committed to finding routes to go forward,\" McCormick said.\nState economists in the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office estimated the tax would raise at least $6 billion for every two-year spending cycle, a 33 percent increase in tax revenue going to the state's current $18 billion general fund budget. That would have been the largest tax increase in Oregon's history, at least by dollar amount, according to Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner.\nThose potential tax hits -- and the promise of new revenue for government services -- spurred businesses and public employee unions to the highest level of campaign spending in Oregon history.\nAs of Friday, opponents reported raising $25.9 million, while supporters reported $16.4 million. The previous record for the costliest Oregon campaign was set in 2014, when opponents of a measure to label genetically modified foods spent nearly $21 million with supporters spending $8 million.\nMeasure 97 started out with 60 percent support in a poll taken a year ago. A poll in September found the same level of support. But by mid-October it had eroded down to 46 percent and by the end of the month only 40 percent of respondents to one poll said they'd vote for it.\nThe central debate throughout the campaign was whether corporations or consumers would end up paying the cost of the tax -- and how much.\nA study by economists in the Legislative Revenue Office found businesses would pass on part of the tax in the form of higher prices, and a typical Oregon family might wind up paying $600 a year. Grocery stores and other low-margin businesses said they would be forced to raise prices, because the 2.5 percent tax would obliterate their slim profit margins.\nSupporters of the measure said no economic modeling -- including in a study they funded, by Portland State University economists -- could accurately estimate the impact of the measure.\nThe backers argued it was too different from gross receipts taxes in other states. And they offered state-by-state shopping comparisons to show that different tax rates didn't result in different prices.\nBut Measure 97 opponents also pointed to a written opinion from a lawyer for the Legislature that said lawmakers could spend the revenue as they wanted simply by passing budget bills, despite language in the measure calling for the money to be spent on early childhood and K-12 education, health care and services for seniors.\nGov. Kate Brown, lawmakers, public employee unions and the business community now face the challenge of coming together after the bruising battle to address the state's ongoing challenges.\nVoters' rejection of Measure 97 means the governor and lawmakers must now pass a tax increase, budget cuts or some combination to fill a projected $1.35 billion budget shortfall in the next two-year budget. That estimate was based on the amount of money needed to preserve existing services and programs.",

In 2016, the Federal Court of Appeal also ordered that the project be reconsidered because of inadequate consultations with affected First Nations.\nThe House of Commons was supposed to spend the day debating a Conservative opposition-day motion about threats to the Canadian economy.\nThe Liberals are under pressure from Western Canadian premiers and Conservative MPs to find a solution to the oil-price crisis, which the Alberta government estimates is costing the country $80 million a day.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Western Canadian Select was trading at US$27.95 a barrel, a US$11 increase from Dec. 3. In contrast, West Texas Intermediate Crude (WTI) was trading at US$53.13.\nThe price increase comes two days after Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced her government will cut oil production by 8.7 per cent starting Jan. 1. Notley has also said Alberta is willing to purchase enough train cars and locomotives to move up to 120,000 barrels of oil by rail a day.\nNotley has repeatedly asked the federal government for help, including a request that Ottawa amend or halt two pending pieces of energy-related legislation (one dealing with environmental assessments, the other a proposed tanker ban on the B.C. coast) that are currently under consideration in the Senate.\nBoth Prairie governments and industry have warned that the two pieces of legislation, which are backed by environmentalists and several Indigenous communities, could halt investment in the energy sector.\nIn an open letter to the prime minister sent Tuesday, Notley and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said the price discount must be put on the agenda of Friday\u2019s meeting of first ministers in Montreal.\n\u201cAs proposed, the meeting agenda does not include any discussion on the crisis facing the energy industry and the price differential that is crippling the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Canadian economy,\u201d the letter reads.\n\u201cA crisis of this magnitude must be reflected in any discussion on \u2018economic competitiveness,\u2019 \u201d the letter continues.\nPremier @RachelNotley and I have formally asked PM @JustinTrudeau to include oil differential crisis on agenda at upcoming First Ministers mtg this week.\nWhen asked about the premiers\u2019 letter, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office replied in an email that the oil differential was \u201calways going to be part of the discussion,\u201d given the matter relates to topics already on the meeting\u2019s agenda, such as competitiveness, jobs and trade diversification.\nIn an open letter published in the Edmonton Journal and Calgary Herald on Tuesday, Alberta MP and Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said \u201ca perfect storm\u201d is behind the current price differential.\n\u201cI know how painful this differential is,\u201d he wrote, but said his government is working with Alberta and Saskatchewan to find solutions to it.\nSohi repeated his instructions to the National Energy Board, asking it to produce a report on current pipeline use and efficiencies. The minister has said he wants to know if more capacity exists in the current pipeline system.\nEarlier this year, the Trudeau government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline from Texas-based Kinder Morgan. But construction has stalled after the Federal Court of Appeal said in August that the environmental assessment was flawed and more consultation was needed with Indigenous Canadians.\nIn 2016, the Trudeau government also approved Enbridge\u2019s Line 3 project to replace the existing pipeline located between Hardisty, Alta., and Gretna, Man.",

The four-team division saw the Peaked Masters go undefeated to earn the division trophy, taking out the Navy Old and Gnarly Goats. Los Abuelos de C2C finished third followed by Mr. Boh in fourth.\nEqually as impressive as \u2014 and probably contributing to \u2014 the Vail Lacrosse Shootout\u2019s robust showing of players 60 and older, the Grandmasters division of players ages 50 to 59 had the most teams of all masters level play, with six squads competing for the championship. Los Viejos de C2C redeemed themselves after taking second in 2017, going home with the division championship on Saturday. The Tombstone team finished second in the division followed by the Eldest Statesmen in third, EMW in fourth, Middlebury in fifth and the Navy Grand Goats in sixth.\nThe 40-and older Supermasters Championship saw the WLF/Magic Wands start full speed ahead without slowing down. Their opponents the Elder Statesmen tried to close the gap throughout the game, but were never quite able to catch up, and the Magic Wands went home with their second consecutive Supermasters championship.\nThe Elder Statesmen finished second in the Supermasters division, followed by Like a Dog in third and Finally 40 in fourth.\nWith their elders now finished, men ages 30 and older kicked off the masters division of play on Sunday, July 1.

    "text": "In 1987, Blessed John Paul II wrote his encyclical letter entitled \"Mother of the Redeemer: On the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Life of the Pilgrim Church.\" It contains a wonderful summary of the teaching of the Church on the meaning, mystery and gift of Mary in the Plan of Salvation. It proceeds through the Scripture, the Sacred Tradition, the Church Councils, and the Magisterial teachings of the Church. The Holy father wrote: \"With good reason, then, at the end of this Millennium, we Christians who know that the providential plan of the Most Holy Trinity is the central reality of Revelation and of faith feel the need to emphasize the unique presence of the Mother of Christ in history, especially during these last years leading up to the year 2000.\n\"The Second Vatican Council prepares us for this by presenting in its teaching the Mother of God in the mystery of Christ and of the Church. If it is true, as the Council itself proclaims, that 'only in the mystery of the Incarnate Word does the mystery of man take on light,' then this principle must be applied in a very particular way to that exceptional \"daughter of the human race,\" that extraordinary \"woman\" who became the Mother of Christ. Only in the mystery of Christ is her mystery fully made clear. Thus has the Church sought to interpret it from the very beginning: the mystery of the Incarnation has enabled her to penetrate and to make ever clearer the mystery of the Mother of the Incarnate Word.\n\"The Council of Ephesus (431 AD) was of decisive importance in clarifying this, for during that Council, to the great joy of Christians, the truth of the divine motherhood of Mary was solemnly confirmed as a truth of the Church's faith.\nMary is the Mother of God (= Theot\u0102\u0142kos), since by the power of the Holy Spirit she conceived in her virginal womb and brought into the world Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is of one being with the Father. \"The Son of God...born of the Virgin Mary...has truly been made one of us,\" has been made man.\n\"Thus, through the mystery of Christ, on the horizon of the Church's faith there shines in its fullness the mystery of his Mother. In turn, the dogma of the divine motherhood of Mary was for the Council of Ephesus and is for the Church like a seal upon the dogma of the Incarnation, in which the Word truly assumes human nature into the unity of his person, without cancelling out that nature.\"\nThe first four ecumenical Councils of the Church confirmed and defined Christian belief about the nature of God and the meaning of the Incarnation, saving life, death, ascension and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Council pronouncements concerning Mary were made in reference to defending the truths about Jesus Christ and God's plan of salvation for the entire human race. That plan included, and still includes, the Mother of God.\nThe Catechism, in keeping with the unbroken tradition of the Church, makes the inseparable connection or link between the humanity of Jesus and the humanity of his Mother, as did Blessed John Paul in his encyclical letter cited above. The first four Councils of the Church, which are almost universally accepted among the broader Christian community even beyond the full communion of the Catholic Church, did the same. St. Gregory the Great (540-604 AD) once affirmed \"I confess that I accept and reverence the four Councils as I do the four Gospels...for they are founded on universal consent.\"\nThe Councils affirmed the core of the Christian claim about who Jesus is and thus, who we can become in Him. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD contended with a priest of Alexandria named Arius who taught that the Word or Son of God (who \"became flesh and dwelt among us\" as Jesus - Jn 1:14) was not God. Misusing passages in John's Gospel (14:28) where Jesus proclaimed \"the Father is greater than I\" Arius denied that the Word of God, was eternal. The bishops at Nicaea considered all the texts of the Gospels (such as Jn 10:30: \"I and the Father are one\") under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and declared that Arius was in error. The Son or Word of God is God (see Jn 1:1) and always existed. This was memorialized in the Nicene Creed. They used a Greek word homoousios, which meant that the Word or Son is of the same \"being\" as God the Father. If the Father is God, so is the Son.\nThe struggle continued for fifty more years before the First Council of Constantinople (381 AD) reaffirmed the creed of Nicaea. This ecumenical council also felt it necessary to affirm the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the \"Lord and Giver of Life\" who with the Father and the Son \"is worshipped and glorified\" and that phrase was added to the Nicene Creed. In the fifth century there were two more councils that addressed questions about Jesus. In the early 5th century a prominent bishop, Nestorius, rejected the title \"theotokos\" or \"God-bearer\" as a proper term for Mary.\nChristians had always affirmed that the mother of Jesus could rightly be called the \"Mother of God\" or \"God-bearer\" because the Gospels teach that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary. Mary's consent, her \"Fiat\" to the message of the Angel Gabriel (see Lk 1:26-38) was an essential element of the faith of the early Church, a model for all Christians. She was viewed as the \"Second Eve\" whose \"Yes\" untied the knot caused by Eve's \"No\".\nA Bishop named Nestorius objected to the title of Theotokos, Mother of God or God Bearer for Mary. The Council of Ephesus met in 431AD and affirmed Mary was the \"Mother of God\" because she is the mother of God in his human nature which, because of the Incarnation, could not be separated from the divine nature. The Council also affirmed that Mary's exercise of her human freedom, her assent, was a significant part of the plan of salvation, giving to the Incarnate Word, Jesus, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, his true and full humanity. When God the Holy Spirit \"overshadowed\" Mary the child born to her was truly God, the Son or Word of God (Lk 1:30-35).\nAfter this Council, a monk, Eutyches claimed that before Jesus took flesh in Mary but that there were two \"natures\" - a divine and a human nature. After the union of the two natures in Mary's womb, only one nature was left in Jesus - the divine nature. Eutyches essentially proposed that the divine nature swallowed up the humanity of Jesus. So Jesus only took on human appearance. The Cappadocian father, Gregory of Nazianzus, once proclaimed \"whatever was not assumed was not healed\". In that we understand the danger of the denial of the sacred humanity of Jesus. Redemption would not be complete.\nThe Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD dealt with this threat to the meaning and implications of the Incarnation of the Word of God. The creed of the Council of Chalcedon declared that Jesus Christ is one person who exists \"in two natures\" - a divine nature and a human nature - which are neither confused (\"blended together\" into a third nature) nor divided or separated. Jesus is fully God and truly and fully human. Thus, the first four ecumenical Councils defined the meaning of the most foundational belief of the Christian faith and, as a result preserved the great promise of that faith for each one of us. In these Councils, as in the Second Vatican Council, what was said about Mary ensured the continued proclamation of the fullness of the truth about Jesus Christ.",

    "text": "CNET's reporters are covering the launch of the much-hyped iPhone 4. Stay tuned for updates from New York City and San Francisco.\nIt's finally here. The much-anticipated iPhone 4 is hitting store shelves on Thursday at 7 a.m. local time in each time zone where it's available.\nCNET has teams of reporters covering the launch in New York City and San Francisco. Marguerite Reardon and Caroline McCarthy will be heading up coverage in New York, while Erica Ogg, Josh Lowensohn, and James Martin will be keeping tabs on what's happening out west.\nThese reporters will be checking in at Apple stores and other locations, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Radio Shack, where iPhone 4s will be sold starting on Thursday. CNET will also let you know how things are going at the AT&T stores where only customers who preordered phones will be able to pick them up. Anyone looking to buy an iPhone off-the-shelf from AT&T will have to wait until Tuesday.\nAT&T says that demand for the iPhone 4 is 10 times what it was for last year's iPhone 3GS. And Apple says it took 600,000 preorders for the new phone through its sales channels.\nIf history is any indication of what to expect, initial sales of the iPhone 4 are likely to be big. Apple sold more than 1 million iPhone 3GS smartphones the first three days it was on sale. The original iPhone sold about 270,000 units during its first weekend in June 2007, while the iPhone 3G sold around 1 million when it launched in July 2008.\nWhile there's little doubt that the lines will long, the big question is whether AT&T's activation system will be able to hold up under the pressure. If the preorder process is any indication of what to expect, iPhone fans may need to be patient. On June 15, thousands of customers trying to preorder the iPhone were met with error messages on AT&T's and Apple's Web sites. AT&T's servers were overwhelmed and the company ended up suspending preorders.\nTo keep up with the latest news from the launch, stay tuned to CNET's updates all day.\nMcCarthy, 6:24 a.m. EDT at the 14th Street Apple Store: About 150 people are in the preorder line for iPhone 4. The line for non-reserved phones is significantly longer. They're telling new arrivals to get in one big line, and then if people have proof of preorder, they sort them into the preorder line.\nReardon, 6:30 a.m. EDT at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store: The lines for the iPhone 4 are wrapped around the block at Apple's flagship store on Fifth Ave. The line for the customers who haven't reserved an iPhone wind down 58th Street and around the block to 59th Street next to the Apple Store. There's also a huge line of people already lined up in the reserved line. These are customers who have reserved their phones in advance and are just waiting to pick them up.\nWhile it's clear the crowds are bigger to get the phone, the hoopla and the party atmosphere from previous iPhone launches seems to be missing. With a half hour to go, no one is chanting yet.\nMcCarthy, 6:41 a.m. EDT: The line stretches all the way from the corner of 14th St. and 9th Ave. down to 10th Ave. (Google Maps should be able to tell you how long this is) and then up around 10th Ave. past the intersection of 15th St. almost to 16th St., but after the corner of 14th and 10th there are gaps in the line because of driveways, a gas station, etc.\nEmployees of the Apple Store are wearing blue iPad T shirts--no special shirts for this launch.\nMcCarthy, 6:44 a.m. EDT: First preorder: Been here since 10:15 p.m. EDT last night, originally had a 3G and lost it> He's a textbook editor for McGraw-Hill, and his name is Zach (26). He was about 42nd in line before they divided it into preorder and non-preorder. First people to show up who didn't preorder the phone got to the store at 3 p.m. EDT yesterday.\nZach says he took the day off work, and got his boss' approval. He is not playing hooky.\nReardon, 6:50 a.m. EDT: The doors open in 10 minutes. People in the back of the line only got here about 20 minutes ago. Jose Marinez, 36, said he has stood in line every year since 2007 to get an iPhone. He isn't worried that Apple will run out of phones, but he is a little worried that AT&T's servers might crash again. He tried to preorder the phone on June 15 and gave up when he couldn't get through on the Web site.\nMcCarthy, 6:58 a.m. EDT: Apple Store employees starting to cheer to rev people up.\nMcCarthy, 7:01 a.m. EDT: Preorders are being let in, 60 people at a time. It's going smoothly so far. Afew minutes later, the first batch of walk-ups (non-preorders) are let into store, but ushered downstairs rather than into the upstairs area. Only about 20 let in.\nMcCarthy, 7:10 a.m. EDT: It's been 10 minutes and the first guy in line has not yet come back out--AT&T activation. Apple Store employee talking to people who show up and wonder how long the wait will be: \"The demand is tremendous. It seems like everybody in New York wants this phone.\"\nMcCarthy, 7:11 a.m. EDT: First customer walks out with phone.\nMcCarthy, 7:17 a.m. EDT: This is going to be a long day for some of these people: there are still hundreds of people in the preorder line--still only one group of 60 has been let in--and the walk-up line is still much much longer. Line going SLOW.\nAn Apple Store employee tells me that they do not yet know when the store will be open to \"regular\" customers for non-iPhone purchases.\nMcCarthy, 7:25 a.m. EDT: Activation time in-store appears to be 10-15 minutes. But the line itself is very slow. A lot of people who may have expected to get to work on time might not.\nLots of reps from companies that resell used iPhones, or organizations that donate them to developing countries, are soliciting people in line.\nThe line for walk-ups is now all the way to corner of 16th St.--and keeps growing.\nReardon, 7:30 a.m. EDT: People have been filing into the Fifth Ave. store for about a half-hour now. The line for people who have reserved iPhones is moving quickly. But the line for people who have not preordered a phone keeps growing. It now ends near the corner of 59th St. and Fifth Ave.--people enter the Apple store on 58th and Fifth Ave.\nReardon, 7:40 a.m. EDT: I just overheard an Apple representative say that everyone standing in line right now without a reservation will likely get a phone. He thinks the line should take two hours to get through.\nMcCarthy, 7:51 a.m. EDT, en route in Manhattan: The RadioShack on 14th St. and 7th Ave. is opening at its usual 9 a.m. time, no one waiting in front, no ads for iPhone 4 in window (in fact, there's still a 3GS poster).\nMcCarthy, 8:18 a.m. EDT at RadioShack in Brooklyn Heights: Across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, about 15 people are clustered in front of the RadioShack on Montague St. It's opening at its regular hour of 9 a.m. The people waiting are a mix of preorders and walk-ups.\nThere are no Apple Stores in Brooklyn, FYI.\nMcCarthy, 8:32 a.m. EDT: A RadioShack employee just arrived at the Brooklyn Heights store. The line is not getting much longer. The first guy has been here since 5:30 a.m. EDT.\nThe 15th person in line is a girl who says her boyfriend is in line at the 14th St. Apple Store. He preordered a phone there and says even the preorder line is moving at a snail's pace; she, meanwhile, preordered at the Montague St. RadioShack: \"I'll probably be back in bed before he even gets to the front of the line.\"\nShe said the two of them waited in line for the original iPhone together but that she's \"over that.\"\nThat said, people at RadioShack know they're taking a gamble because they've heard the store may have as few as 10 phones in stock.\nReardon, 8:36 a.m. EDT: I just spent some time inside the Fifth Ave. Apple store with CNET TV's camera crew. Unlike with previous iPhone launches, the activation process is going pretty smoothly--customers are in and out within 25 minutes. No one I talked to reported any problems. Customers with preorders were allowed in the store first. And by 8:00 a.m. the store was letting in people without preorders. But the line outside for non-preorder customers doesn't look to have moved much yet.\nMcCarthy, 8:36 a.m. EDT: A RadioShack employee comes out of the store and says they don't have as many phones as they'd hoped. Even though the store technically isn't open yet, he's letting the people who preordered phones come in one by one.\nMcCarthy, 8:43 a.m. EDT: If people who preordered the phone aren't in line right now, it'll be first come, first serve. Only 4 each of the 16GB and 32GB models are in stock. Guy at RadioShack has a list and if people's names aren't near the top of it, they don't get a phone now. The line breaks up once people learn they won't get one.\nReardon, 8:52 a.m. EDT: It's a good thing that Apple is offering a tutorial at one of the tables for people to show them how to use the features on their new phones. Some customers were having trouble getting the FaceTime app to work. Two guys who had come to the store together to get their iPhones were eager to show off the new FaceTime video chat application. But at first, neither one was able to figure out how to launch the chat. Once they realized that they initiated the video call by clicking on the FaceTime button in their contacts, the application wasn't working for one of the guys. Even though FaceTime video calls are made only over a Wi-Fi connection, users still need to have a 3G connection to initiate the call.\nAnd unfortunately for these friends, one of their phones wasn't getting 3G cellular signal from AT&T in the Apple store.\nMcCarthy, 9:00 a.m. EDT: The people waiting in line at the Brooklyn Heights RadioShack had a definitive answer as to whether they'd be getting an iPhone today before the store had even opened for business. Most, unfortunately, walked away empty-handed.\nReardon, 9:06 a.m. EDT: The line at the Fifth Ave. Apple Store for customers who did not preorder an iPhone 4 is starting to go down. It is still wrapped around the block, but it's not to the corner anymore.\nReardon, 9:45 a.m. EDT at the Best Buy on 62nd Street and Broadway: 9:45 a.m. I was just informed by a sales manager that Best Buy stores in Manhattan and possibly throughout the country will only be selling preordered iPhone 4s. He said he doesn't expect Best Buy stores in New York City to have iPhone 4s in stock until next week at the earliest, or the first week of July.\nOgg, 6:49 a.m. PDT at the Stockton Street Apple Store in San Francisco: The reservations line is a third longer than the walk-in line, stretching around the corner two city blocks. While a few camped out overnight, the crowd mostly began forming around 4:30 a.m. PDT today. As usual, there are people passing out coffee and donuts to the eager iPhone buyers gathered here.\nOgg, 6:55 a.m. PDT: An update on the early entrepreneurs we wrote about on Tuesday: Chris Bank, the first man in line Tuesday, who was selling his spot for $200, actually handed it off for $400. The taker was Joe Sabia of San Francisco, who saw the story on CNET and decided to buy the spot and do it for \"just a really fun story.\" This will be his first iPhone.\nJoe Lobato, who was trying to trade his spot for a new iPhone, because he couldn't afford it, found a family of three to buy two phones--one for him, one for them. So at least a couple of the early entrepreneurs here were successful.\nReardon, 9:56 a.m. EDT: I just checked with my colleague Erica Ogg, who covers Apple. She said that some Best Buy stores are only selling preorder phones, while others will have phones in stock for people coming to buy them off the street. I guess the best bet is to call your local Best Buy store in advance to find out if they have them. According to the manager at a Best Buy store in Manhattan, all stores in the New York City district will only be selling preorders today.\nOgg, 6:58 a.m. PDT: The store is about to open, camera crews are crowding the entrance. No chanting by employees--yet. Then, as the Apple employees come down the stairs to form a receiving line inside the store, those waiting in line start to cheer.\nOgg, 7:02 a.m. PDT: The countdown from employees begins...and the doors open at two minutes after 7 a.m. The first people with reservations start pouring into the San Francisco store. So far everything seems fairly orderly. Only those who reserved have been let in so far. The people who made purchases appear to be waiting patiently.\nLowensohn, 7:07 a.m. PDT at the Apple Store in Palo Alto: The line here was considerably longer than that for the iPad. The guys at the front of the line had, like many others, spent the night in front of the store, though they only got there at 10:30 a.m. the day before.\nOgg, 7:11 a.m. PDT: In San Francisco, the first buyers emerge, all smiles, and of course, to the proverbial pop of flash bulbs.\nReardon, 10:14 a.m. EDT: Here is some more detail on the Best Buy inventory. According to an FAQ that Best Buy has put on its Web site, only stores that have more inventory than the preorders will be selling the iPhone on launch day (that is, today). Since preorders have been so high, Best Buy's Web site says it's unlikely that many stores will have enough inventory to sell iPhone 4s to walk-in customers.\nAnother tidbit to keep in mind is that just because you've preordered a phone with Best Buy doesn't guarantee that you will be able to pick up that phone today. Unlike Apple, which has said that it will have enough iPhone 4s available on launch day for everyone who preordered the devices, Best Buy says on its Web site that even preorders are first come, first served.\nFrom the FAQ: \"If I pre-ordered the iPhone 4 at Best Buy, will I get it on launch day, June 24th, 2010? -- This is not guaranteed and is completely dependent on how many the store receives from Apple. Any inventory received will be used to fulfill outstanding preorders in the order they were placed. For example, if the store has twenty preorders on launch day but only received fifteen phones from Apple, then the first fifteen preorders should receive their phone on launch day.\"\nBest Buy says that customers who preordered iPhone 4s, but did not get their phones on launch day, will get them when the next shipment of phones comes in from Apple.\nOgg, 7:17 a.m. PDT: After about 15 minutes, the first walk-in buyers are allowed to enter the store. Sabia, who paid $400 and slept one night on the sidewalk, gets a cheer from some of his fellow waiters-in-line.\nBank, who slept outside this store since Tuesday, gets a cheer from Apple employees, who he's clearly befriended, as he enters the store to make his purchase.\nOgg, 7:27 a.m. PDT: Just as at the iPad launch here a few months ago, Apple's chief designer, Jonathan Ive, emerges from the Stockton Street store quietly, nodding politely at the few fans who recognize him.\nOgg, 7:36 a.m. PDT: After a half-hour, only two walk-in customers have been let inside. Looks like it's going to take a lot of patience for people who did not have a reservation.\nOgg, 7:59 a.m. PDT: The first walk-in buyer here in San Francisco, Joe Sabia, emerges with his iPhone. He decided to not sign an AT&T contract, so he paid full price for the phone. \"That way if it goes to Verizon in the next few months, I can use it there.\"\nLowensohn, 8:04 a.m. PDT: Both lines here in Palo Alto continue to grow. The walk-in line has now stretched around the block. Likewise, the line for those who have preordered is around the same size as it was for iPad walk-ins back in April.\nCNET ran into brothers Christopher and James Nicholson, who camped out overnight here. Christopher explained that he had done the same when the Palo Alto store first opened, but that it was his brother's first time doing so. Another first for James was the latest iPhone--he had not owned any of the previous iterations. The two brought a cooler, as well as a pillows and blankets. \"I was kind of bummed [Robert] Scoble wasn't here,\" said Christopher. \"When I was here for the iPad launch, that guy was a lot of fun.\"\nLowensohn, 8:48 a.m. PDT: People with reservations who got here at 6:30 this morning are just now getting their handsets. On the walk-in line, it's still going to the folks who camped overnight.\nAlso overheard two employees saying the store was expecting a midmorning stock delivery. Though from the looks of what they have on the floor, there's a ton of stock.\nLowensohn, 9:01 a.m. PDT: Apple appears to be selling a ton of bumpers--a casing for the sides of the iPhone 4. Almost everyone I've seen walking out without a bag seems to have bought one. And most are black.\nReardon, 12:30 p.m. EDT at the Apple Store on Broadway and 67th Street: I'm now on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The store here is only serving preorder customers right now. Walk-ins who got i line early this morning are still being served. But Apple has since cut the line off. Patrick van Rosendaal, 34, who lives on the Upper East Side got in line here at 6:30 a.m. He was just going into the store around 12:15 p.m. He and everyone else in the walk-up line will have to get the 16GB black version of the iPhone 4. This store ran out of 32GB devices around 10 a.m., people standing in line said.\n\"Normally, I would have waited,\" Rosendaal said. He's had every version of the iPhone that has come out since 2007. Every year he has upgraded to the new version, but he's never waited in line at a store. After about six hours of waiting he said he doubts he'll ever do it again.\nReardon, 12:42 p.m. EDT: Apple sales representatives are telling people who are coming up to the line that they need a reservation at this point to get an iPhone 4. The line has gotten much shorter in the past half-hour. Customers who have preordered phones for this location have until 10 p.m. tonight to pick up their phones. If they don't show up, they will forfeit their reservation and the phone will be released for sale to walk-in customers starting tomorrow morning. Apple employees said they weren't sure if this location will get a new order of phones tomorrow. But they expect a line to form early in the morning to pick up any phones that weren't claimed today.\nMcCarthy, 1:45 p.m. EDT: A friend I bumped into when I showed up at the 14th St. Apple store in NYC at 6:15 a.m. is still in line.\nLowensohn, 10:56 a.m. PDT: The lines here in Palo Alto are still going, but the one for walk-ins is now considerably shorter than earlier in the day. The rain has given way to warm and sunny weather, which prompted iPhone advertising and analytics company Mobclix to park a large Ben & Jerry's ice cream truck next to the line. At this point it's safe to say anyone who's spent more than a few hours in line will have had enough sugar to put down an elephant.\nLinegoers did get another treat in the form of a FedEx and UPS truck both pulling up across the street from the store and unloading piles of brown boxes, though the Apple employees who were unloading them were quick to point out that they were not additional iPhone units. CNET later confirmed that many of the boxes contained iPad models with 3G antennas. But the truck's arrival does explain the earlier rumors of a delivery on its way.\nReardon, 2 p.m. EDT: At the AT&T store at 95th and Broadway. It looks like preordering the phone and picking it up from an AT&T store may have been the best bet for customers looking to get an iPhone 4 on launch day with no hassles or long lines. I just checked out an AT&T store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. There was no line in the store, and a sales representative said that no significant line had formed at any point of the day. Customers came into the store at their leisure to pick up their preordered phones today.\n\"There were a few people in line early at 7 a.m.,\" he said. \"But most people were able to just walk in and pick up their new phones.\" Even customers who hadn't expected to get their phone delivered today were able to get their iPhone, he added.\nAT&T informed customers earlier this week that the company would only sell preordered phones at its retail locations on launch day. It will begin selling the phones to people who were not able to preorder starting Tuesday, June 29. The sales representative said he expects the store to have plenty of phones in stock for the release on Tuesday, but he urges customers to get in line early. The store opens at 7 a.m.\nLowensohn, 11:40 a.m. PDT: Here at the Apple store in Palo Alto, people without reservations now have to wait 4 to 5 hours, while people with reservations have to wait approximately 3 hours. The line for people with reservations is also approximately five times the size of the walk-in line, but it's moving faster.\nFolks with reservations have until 9 p.m. to get in line and be guaranteed a phone today.\nLowensohn, 1:14 p.m. PDT: Just a quick update from the Palo Alto store, where the people currently at the front of the reservation line have now been waiting for 7 hours to get their phones.",

    "text": "North Dakota's energy boom led the state to have the fastest-growing economy in 2012, increasing at five times the national average.\nPropelled by a massive energy boom, North Dakota once again captured the title of the nation's hottest economy, with a growth rate five times the national average.\nNorth Dakota's economy posted a 13.4% growth rate in 2012, according to a report released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That's nearly three times as fast as the number two state, Texas, and trounces the national average of 2.5%.\nThis is the third year in a row that North Dakota took the top spot in BEA's state-by-state report on gross domestic product (GDP). The muscle behind the boom is a surge in oil production from the Bakken Shale, an underground rock formation in the northwestern part of the state.\nThanks to high oil prices and new drilling technology -- including the controversial hydraulic fracturing, better known as \"fracking\" -- oil production in North Dakota is now six times higher than it was in 2007. In 2012, North Dakota surpassed Alaska and California to become the second largest oil-producing state in the nation behind Texas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nThe boom has attracted workers from all over the country and rippled out to incorporate not only the oil and gas drilling sectors but also other industries that supply them, including wholesale goods and transportation.\n\"There's nothing like an oil boom to get things rolling,\" North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple told CNNMoney.\nUnlike some other states, North Dakota has a tax specifically targeting oil and gas production. That tax has allowed the state government to cover 80% of the cost of public schools, greatly reducing property taxes on the local level, Dalrymple said. It also allowed for a reduction in state income taxes, and covered the cost of building roads and other infrastructure to accommodate the influx of workers.\nThere are still downsides to the rapid growth. Housing prices in parts of the state are as high as Manhattan, and some areas are having problems obtaining enough water. But the state's unemployment rate is below 3%, and North Dakota is \"hanging on to our college graduates like we never have before,\" Dalrymple said.\nOil and gas is the biggest economic driver, but Dalrymple said his state is also doing a good job attracting other industries. Deere & Co. (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT) are building factories in the state, and an Amazon (AMZN) service center is also in the works.\nThe second fastest-growing state was Texas, which benefited from oil and gas activity in its own shale formations as well as a strong showing in its manufacturing sector.\nIn fact, the manufacturing of durable goods -- things that last longer than three years, such as cars, appliances or software -- grew by more than 9% nationwide in 2012, according the BEA. It was the leading contributor to growth in 22 states, the bureau said.\nIn Oregon -- the third fastest-growing state -- manufacturing contributed almost 3 percentage points to the state's GDP.\nComputers and electronics dominate Oregon's manufacturing industry, with Intel (INTC) in particular leading the way, said Josh Lehner, a state economist. The company has been expanding its chip manufacturing plants, as well as its research and development unit in the state.\nWashington and Minnesota rounded out the five fastest-growing states. Washington's growth was led by tech and manufacturing, while manufacturing and finance fueled Minnesota's.\nThe laggards: Connecticut was the only state to see an actual drop in economic activity, with its gross domestic product falling by 0.1%. Connecticut has a large insurance and finance sector, which posted a fairly sharp decline.\nEconomists have said growth in the insurance and finance industry will likely lag other sectors as the market continues to adapt to the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank finance reform bill, the implementation details of which are still being worked out, is also expected to limit the sector's growth.\nDelaware was the second slowest-growing state, dragged down by contractions in the construction and wholesale trade sectors.\nNew Mexico, the fourth slowest-growing state, also saw a decline in its construction sector.\nDeclining construction activity was not the norm nationwide. Construction activity grew by 3.2% across the country in 2012, BEA said -- the first annual growth posted by the sector in eight years.\nSouth Dakota was also a slow-growing state, and had the sector with the biggest single drop: agriculture, which knocked 2 percentage points off the state's GDP growth.\nSouth Dakota is a big cattle-producing state. The drought in the summer of 2012 pushed up the prices of corn and other grains, squeezing profits for ranchers that use the crops for feed.",

Fans of Swedish meatballs and therapeutic DIY-furniture-assembly will have even more room to roam as the megalithic new store will be twice as big as the original 242,000-square-foot location built in 1990 located about a mile down San Fernando Road from the new site near the 5 freeway.\nOnce completed, the new IKEA near San Fernando Boulevard and Providencia Avenue will be the largest in the country\u2014roughly 6,000 square feet larger than the current record-holder in Schaumburg, Illinois, according to the Burbank Leader.

There will also be \"50 inspirational room-settings, three model home interiors, a supervised children&apos;s play area, and a larger (600-seat) restaurant serving Swedish specialties.\" So, yes plenty more seats to enjoy those coveted Swedish meatballs.\nThe new, gargantuan IKEA is expected to open in the spring of 2017, when you&apos;ll hopefully have plenty of spare time to get lost in the sprawling store.\nCurrently the largest IKEA in the world is just outside Seoul, South Korea, a beast of a store coming in at 635,070 square feet.

But when our interests and values are at stake, we have a responsibility to act. That is what happened in Libya over the course of these last six weeks.\"\nBut he also underscored the limits of US military action as he sought to counter criticism that he lacked clear objectives and a credible exit strategy in the conflict.\n\"I can report that we have stopped Gaddafi's deadly advance,\" Obama told military officers at the National Defense University in Washington, 10 days after ordering US participation in Western-led air strikes.\n\"We will deny the regime arms, cut off its supply of cash, assist the opposition, and work with other nations to hasten the day when Gaddafi leaves power,\" Obama said.\nBut he added that \"it may not happen overnight\" and acknowledged that Gaddafi may be able to cling to power. \"Broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake,\" he said.\nObama spoke on the eve of a 35-nation conference in London to tackle the crisis in the North African oil-exporting country and weigh political options for ending Gaddafi's 41-year rule.\nObama's challenge was to define the limited purpose and scope of the US mission in Libya for Americans preoccupied with domestic economic concerns and weary of costly wars in two other Muslim countries, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBut his words may not be enough to mollify Republican opponents who say he has failed to lead in recent global crises ranging from Middle East unrest to Japan's nuclear emergency.\nObama's prime-time speech came a day after NATO agreed to assume full responsibility for military operations in Libya, ending uncertainty about who would take over the lead from US forces. \"The US will play a supporting role for the coalition,\" he stated.\nHe said the handover would take place on Wednesday.\nThe alliance's decision gave a boost to Obama's effort to show Americans he was making good on his commitment to limit the US military's involvement in Libya. NATO will take charge of air strikes that have targeted Gaddafi's military infrastructure as well as a no-fly zone and an arms embargo.\nThe White House also hopes Obama can score political points at home from gains on the battlefield by Libyan rebels emboldened by the Western air assault on Gaddafi's loyalists.",

Now Afghan Fighters Are a Worry at Home.\nYAKAWLANG, Afghanistan \u2014 Iran has trained and deployed thousands of Shiite Afghans as shock troops in Syria\u2019s sectarian war. Members of the Afghan unit, the Fatemiyoun Division, wear a shoulder patch recounting words of praise from Iran\u2019s supreme leader as a badge of honor.\nWhat those fighters might do when they come home is now very much on the minds of officials who fear that Afghanistan may become the next great sectarian battleground between Iran, as the declared guardian of Shiites, and Saudi Arabia, long the sponsor of conservative Sunni doctrine around the world.\nThere is reason for worry. First, there\u2019s a history: The factional divisions that drove Afghanistan\u2019s devastating civil war in the 1990s were seized on by foreign powers who were seeking proxies. And there\u2019s a new concern: A stark increase in attacks against Afghanistan\u2019s Shiite minority, mostly by Sunni extremists loyal to the Islamic State, is already providing Iran a pretext to increase its meddling in the country.\nThe attacks have received wide coverage in the Iranian news media. And one Fatemiyoun fighter who returned about three months ago from Syria said the violence against Afghan Shiites was a frequent topic raised by their commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\nThe Afghan fighter had returned to his home in Yakawlang, a village in Bamian Province where the Taliban massacred more than 300 Shiites in 2001. Every year, hundreds of residents kneel on the dirt in a hilltop cemetery and beat their chests in mourning for their loved ones, their names listed on a metal sign worn out by time and covered in rust.\n\u201cThe Guards commanders were saying that, if it comes to it, we will make Bamian into a base for you, a base for Fatemiyoun,\u201d said the returning fighter, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being singled out for attack.\n\u201cThere was always talk about that; the commander would say that one day you will go defend in your own country,\u201d said another fighter, who had lived in Iran for 20 years as a refugee before he joined to go to Syria. He said he enlisted after he saw a video of Islamic State fighters \u201cplaying football with a chopped head.\u201d His relatives said he joined after a romantic heartbreak.\nIran has long relied more on soft power than armed might in Afghanistan, playing up its cultural, religious and economic influence in western Afghan districts near the border. And though Iran resents the presence of the United States military on its border, it has mostly supported the American-backed administration in Kabul, choosing stability over chaos.\nBut as the war in Afghanistan has stretched late into a second decade, and with the stability of the central government in question, Iran has begun hedging its bets, American and Afghan officials say. That has extended to improving its ties with the Taliban, a group it had long seen as an ideological enemy.\nAfghan officials acknowledge that they have not yet seen evidence that Iran was actively rallying Fatemiyoun veterans. But the officials are deeply concerned that the groundwork is being laid. And statements by Iran\u2019s military leaders, as well as their use of Afghan fighters in other conflicts, suggests that Iran sees the force as an asset in future engagements.\nBrig. Gen. Ismail Qaani, the deputy commander of the Quds force within the Revolutionary Guards, recently told a memorial for Afghan fighters that Syria was just a temporary goal in a larger vision.\n\u201cFatemiyoun is a new culture \u2014 a collection of brave men who do not see boundaries and borders in defending Islamic values,\u201d General Qaani said, as quoted in the local Iranian media.\nThe war in Yemen is one indication of how Afghans are already being drawn deeper into the Iranian-Saudi rivalry, on both sides. Not only did Iran send smaller units of the Fatemiyoun to cross Syrian borders and fight in Yemen, but at least 1,000 Sunni Afghan refugees from camps in Pakistan have also been recruited to fight on Saudi Arabia\u2019s behalf in Yemen, according to three senior Afghan officials.\nThe core of what is now the Fatemiyoun Division included fighters from Shiite militias that had Iranian support during the Afghan civil war. Some even went to Iraq to fight on behalf of Iran against Saddam Hussein, or to Lebanon to oppose the Israeli invasion.\nMany of the Afghan fighters, mostly recruited from among Afghan refugees or illegal laborers in Iran, join for the salary of about $600 a month, and for the promise of Iranian residency paperwork after a deployment to Syria, which usually lasts three months. But they soon realize that the benefits are designed as a hook: The paperwork needs to be validated every year, and that requires enlisting again.\nAfghan officials say the Iranian police have intensified a crackdown on illegal Afghan immigrants, arresting as many as 200 a day. When they arrive at deportation centers, Iranian military officers are there to offer another option.\n\u201cThey said: \u2018You had come from Afghanistan to work, to make money. We give you two options: You go to Syria, and we pay you money. Or you go back to your country,\u2019\u201d said the former fighter in Yakawlang, who asked to be identified only as Jawed. He was detained while working at an Iranian construction site and taken to a deportation center where, out of 200 Afghan detainees, he became one of about 60 who chose to serve in Syria. After returning to Afghanistan, he joined the Afghan Army.\nExtensive ideological indoctrination is a central part of their service. Recruits are told the war in Syria is a defense of some of the holiest shrines of the Shiite faith from attack by the Islamic State \u2014 a group their recruiters then describe as a creation of the United States to destabilize the Middle East.\n\u201cMy intention was Syria, to defend the shrine,\u201d said the Afghan fighter who returned to his home in Yakawlang, and who wanted to be identified only by the name Abas.\nAbas described his fellow Afghan fighters being pitched into battles that resembled the brutality of the Afghan civil war.\nOther fighters described similarly heavy casualties. One said 15 of his comrades were killed on the first night they arrived at the front lines. And Jawed said there was a day when his unit lost 45 men.\nFollow Mujib Mashal and Fatima Faizi on Twitter: @MujMash and @FatmaFaizi.",

Signing one such pitcher for bigger money \u2014 say, Blevins or right-hander Joe Blanton \u2014 could limit the team\u2019s options.\n*The Indians continue to explore the market, and bullpen coach Jason Bere was one of two representatives from the team to watch Craig Breslow\u2019s throwing session on Monday, according to a scout in attendance. Breslow impressed scouts by throwing at a lower arm slot. The Mets and Dodgers each had two officials attend the session as well, and the Jays and Cubs were among the other clubs represented.\n*The Dodgers like Blevins and Blanton, but could pivot if a better value emerges. One problem: The team only wants to offer a one-year deal, perhaps taking it out of play on the more popular choices.\n*The Nationals \u2014 after bidding more than $80 million for Kenley Jansen, including deferrals \u2014 remain without a proven closer, but are less willing to spend on lesser relievers and reluctant to trade prospects.\n*The Mets are exploring free-agent and trade opportunities, with Blevins and righties Sergio Romo and Joe Smith among their free-agent targets. Whether the team is willing to spend significant dollars is unclear.\n*Romo and Blanton appear to be the top right-handed targets, with Smith, Fernando Salas and David Hernandez on the next tier. The White Sox\u2019 David Robertson, Rays\u2019 Alex Colome and Braves\u2019 Arodys Vizcaino remain trade options, but the acquisition costs in each case might be prohibitive.\n*The Yankees are remaining in touch with agents for the available lefties, but only are interested in signing one who would accept a low base salary or non-roster deal.\n*The Angels, White Sox, Twins and Reds are among the other clubs seeking bullpen help.",

    "text": "Getting involved with a volunteer fire department is an incredibly rewarding way to make a positive contribution to your community. It is often a stepping stone to starting a career in a full-time fire department.\nThat said, it\u2019s not something that everyone can undertake. It takes a great deal physical stamina and mental strength to make this kind of commitment.\nWhat should I know about becoming a volunteer firefighter?\nKeep a clear head in life-or-death situations.\nMaintain your composure when assisting traumatic events like auto crash injuries and fatalities.\nPut yourself in extreme situations, such as going into burning buildings, crawling through tight spaces and entering other hazardous environments.\nMost volunteer fire departments want you to devote a minimum amount of time to service, so make sure you have time in your schedule and the flexibility to make that work. It also means that you must have the time to devote to the requisite firefighter training course. The length of the training can vary by state and the level of certification required \u2014 a Firefighter I certification may take six months of attending class two to three days per week.\nYou must also commit to staying in great physical condition to maintain the stamina to perform the necessary firefighting tasks. Eat right, exercise and reduce or eliminate habits that can adversely affect your health, like tobacco and alcohol use. Here are three specific steps to take to become a volunteer firefighter.\nThe first step should always be to make sure that there is a need. During your call or visit, ask questions about the process so you understand what to expect as you become a volunteer firefighter.\nIf there isn\u2019t a volunteer fire station in your community, check out surrounding areas.\nSome fire departments do have residency restrictions, so ask about those in your call.\nCall the non-emergency number and avoid tying up the fire dispatcher.\nMany fire stations will welcome you to drop in if they\u2019re not busy.\nSome fire departments let you ride along with them, or tour their station to give you firsthand experience working in fire safety.\nThey can also direct you to the proper authorities to help you get signed up.\nA background check to see if you have anything in your history that would prevent you from becoming a volunteer firefighter.\nClearance by a doctor or a physical ability test, some fire departments require both.\nFire departments controlled by a municipal government often require a full application process, usually including a drug test.\nIf your application is approved, the next step in becoming a volunteer fireman or firewoman is to take the training course. The time requirement of these programs varies, but all firefighters must take a minimum 110-hour National Fire Protection Association-certified course.\nWhile this may not be as glamorous as fighting fires, all are an important part of running a volunteer fire department.\nMany departments offer emergency medical services and encourage members to earn EMS certifications. Being an EMT prior to applying to the station will boost your odds of acceptance in many cases.\nWhatever capacity you choose to become involved in with your local volunteer fire department, it will most likely be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life.",

That question is at the heart of this week\u2019s installment of the Global Research News Hour.\nIn the first half hour, past guest Dmitry Orlov returns to the show to bring us up to speed on some of the latest developments. The Russian-American commentator addresses some of the actions in recent months including the Skripal affair and the stand-off with Israel over the shooting down of a Russian plane. He compares and contrasts the two countries\u2019 military postures and their differing objectives. He also examines the impacts of the sanctions regime and its implications for international political and economic relations.\nOur second guest, Ron Ridenour, expands on the theme of his latest book, The Russian Peace Threat: Pentagon on Alert, which provides a historical context for the renewed cold war, deconstructs the propaganda depicting Russia as a menace, and details some of America\u2019s far from benevolent records over the past century. He also hints at where the path to peace may lie.\nDmitry Orlov is a Russian-American writer, blogger and geopolitical analyst based in Moscow. He has degrees in Computer Engineering and Linguistics and has worked in the fields of high energy physics, internet commerce, advertising and network security. He is the author of Reinventing Collapse: The Soviet Experience and American Prospects and Shrinking the Technosphere: Getting a Grip on the Technologies that Limit our Autonomy, Self-sufficiency and Freedom. His blog site is cluborlov.com.\nGlobal Research: We\u2019re joined by Dmitry Orlov. He is a Russian-American writer, blogger, and geopolitical analyst.

His books include Reinventing Collapse: The Soviet Experience and American Prospects and Shrinking The Technosphere: Getting A Grip On The Technologies That Limit Our Autonomy Self-Sufficiency, And Freedom. He joins us here from Moscow. Thanks so much for coming back to the show Dimitri.\nDmitry Orlov: Good to be with you Michael.\nDO: Well it\u2019s a bit of a wake-up call for the Israelis because Russia has been extremely accommodating in everything that comes, when it comes to Israel\u2019s security concerns. There is the realization that the rhetoric coming from Tehran has been, you know, quite virulent, you know, Iran is still telling itself that it has the goal of destroying Israel. There\u2019s no way that Israel can avoid responding to such a provocation, and the fact that there are now Iranian troops close to the Israeli border, and that there is weapons manufacturing going on on Syrian territory is something that is a concern to them that the Russians have to allow Israel to take care of its own security concerns.\nBut the Israelis have acted most irresponsibly because they gave less than a minute warning that this attack was coming. They misnamed the targets, and they misbehaved in the airspace in the sense that they couldn\u2019t have not seen this big lumbering propeller plane that was absolutely no threat to anyone, and they knew that there would be some anti-aircraft fire and drew it not on themselves but on this plane. There are some other, you know unfortunate mishaps that occurred, which are all coming out as a result of the investigation, so it\u2019s still early to say.\nBut the response was basically to, you know, a dressing-down from Russia to Israelis, saying you cannot do this anymore, and the response was to arm the Syrians with a more up-to-date air defense system which was probably already in place. It was just handed over to Syrian command.\nI don\u2019t think that this is a major development. I think Russia and Israel are going to patch things up. I don\u2019t think Israel is going to stop attacking, stop attacking things, on the ground in Syria, that, you know, actions that they see as provocative. They are very fearful of precision rockets, precision weapons being built in Syria that can be smuggled into Syria or even fired, smuggled into Israel, or even fired into Israel from Lebanon or from Syria itself.\nDO: Well there is, there will be no declaration of surrender. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. Basically, what the US does in Syria, similar to what it does everywhere else, it generates activity. It generates activity in order to be in a position to order more weapons systems, more munitions, basically chew through more materiel, because that\u2019s what the contractors require, and those contractors, military contractors, finance various congressional campaigns. That\u2019s the entire political ecosystem, and what happens on the ground is sort of a sideshow.\nNow in terms of strategic objectives, whatever they are, the US definitely isn\u2019t achieving them. There\u2019s that encampment they have in Al-Tanf in the south, there are a few other locations in the north where they\u2019re playing along with the Kurds, which is poisoning their relationship with Turkey. They did completely destroy Raqqa and made absolutely no effort to clean it up, to restore it, so there are still rotting bodies there buried under a piles of rubble, and it\u2019s been many months. It\u2019s basically a humanitarian atrocity that they\u2019ve perpetuated in Raqqa, but they\u2019re not achieving anything except wasting money and war materiel. And I think that that is actually their goal at this point is to generate military activity.\nDO: Oh, no, absolutely not. Basically, Russian posture, the Russian posture is to make sure that the US and NATO have absolutely no plan whatsoever to attack Russia, or to attack Russia\u2019s allies. Perish the thought. But other than that, Russia\u2019s posture is completely defensive, and American posture, because there is no need to defend the American homeland from anyone, nobody is planning to attack the United States, is purely offensive.\nDO: It\u2019s really hard to figure out what is going to snap first. There\u2019s definitely a huge amount of tension between Washington and the European Union. There is a huge amount of tension building up within the European Union itself, because the whole liberal juggernaut that started bringing in unlimited quantities of migrants into Europe, you know that is definitely running into a huge, huge problem, huge conflict that is internal to the EU.\nNow, the relationship between the EU and Russia has not really been all that badly damaged by Washington and by these sanctions that the Europeans have gone along with willy-nilly, many of them complaining all along the way. And, definitely, in terms of, for instance, energy cooperation between the EU and Russia is back on track because there are really no other options that the EU has to supply itself with natural gas other than to do business with Russia, and at this point that means also to circumvent the Ukraine because nobody really wants to do business with the Ukraine anymore. It\u2019s basically a sort of poisoned chalice at this point.\nYou know, in terms of what the sanctions have done to the Russian economy, yes, they cost them a couple of percentage points of GDP growth, but the beneficial effect of those sanctions is often underestimated. It really woke Russia up to the fact that it has to become self-sufficient in many areas, and it has become self-sufficient in numerous areas and is working very hard to achieve self-sufficiency in more areas and to find new trading partners that aren\u2019t going to sanction them. So, the sanctions have really woken up the Russians to the fact that the Americans are not their friends, will never be their friends, and have prompted them to act accordingly.\nGR: The US economic situation, they have an unsustainable debt crisis. It doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re ever going to be able to crawl out of it, they don\u2019t have the ability to maintain the, their current trajectory. I mean, we\u2019re probably looking at another stock market crash, probably sooner rather than later, and I think the writing is on the wall in that regard. That\u2019s bound to affect the way the US comports itself in the world, even though they won\u2019t say it out loud. I mean, you suggested that earlier.\nSo that you have, you know, falling prices on some things and hyperinflation in other areas. There\u2019ll be huge economic distortions, and the rest of the world will simply have to co-exist. They have a hoard of dollars, they use that hoard of dollars in order to trade with each other, they have contracts signed that are all in dollars. So, how do you de-dollarize that? It\u2019s a gigantic task.\nWith the Skripal affair, it\u2019s preposterous throughout. There\u2019s absolutely no evidence behind the British story, and there are a lot of facts that are just completely contradictory and negate the narrative that has been voiced. And so the Russians are happy to basically sit back and ignore all of that. They know that there will be sanctions, these sanctions have nothing to do with chemical weapons, they have nothing to do with anything except one fact: Russia is sitting on a stockpile of energy resources that will last it for hundreds of years.\nThey\u2019re basically jumping up and down mad that they have this problem that they can\u2019t solve. They can\u2019t attack Russia militarily. They\u2019re trying to attack Russia economically, but that\u2019s not working. They\u2019re trying to isolate Russia, and as a result of that Russia is strengthening ties with countries all over the world. You know the SCO organization is now almost half of the world\u2019s GDP, almost half of the world\u2019s population. And it\u2019s a security organization that Russia is part of.\nYou know, they try to stage little provocations like the little training exercises along the Russian border in the Baltics that are supposed to frighten Russia. Now if NATO attacked Russia, Russia would have them arrested. It doesn\u2019t really make sense as a plan, but it makes sense as an internal narrative, something that these incompetent Western leaders can tell their own people.",

Missing or inadequate insulation also leads to higher utility bills due to wasted energy, and may result in more maintenance and more frequent replacement of your heating equipment. And, a well-insulated basement is a selling point when it comes time to put your home on the market. Save money and protect the environment from the effects of air pollution by installing insulation in your basement to conserve energy.\nMeasure the depth of your exposed wood framing using a tape measure. Choose your insulation based on the available space and your budget.\nPut on your safety glasses and gloves before handling the insulation.\nCut fiberglass batts to fit between the exposed wooden studs. Size the batts to fit snugly between the framing members so that friction will be enough to hold them in place.\nPlace the batts into the wall cavity, adding several layers as needed to achieve the desired R-value.\nFinish the walls with drywall or leave unfinished, as desired.\nCover the entire wall with a vapor barrier, such as 6 mm polyethylene. Secure the edges of each sheet to the wall using construction adhesive, and overlap each row by 6-inches. Tape the seams of the vapor barrier using heavy clear tape.\nMeasure over 16 inches from one corner of each masonry wall. Mark this spot with a marker or chalk, then continue to make marks every 16 inches along the length of the wall.\nPlace 1 by 2 inch furring strips at the marks you made on the wall. Use concrete or masonry screws to secure each furring strip to the wall.\nCut rigid foam sheets to fit between the furring strips using your utility knife. Size the sheets so they fit snugly between each strip.\nInsert the sheets of rigid foam between the furring strips. If friction isn't enough to hold the sheets in place, add a bit of construction adhesive to the back of each sheet. Add a second layer of foam to maximize R-value.\nCover the furred-out wall with 1/2-inch drywall. Screw the drywall to the furring strips using drywall screws and finish as desired.\nEnergy Savers recommends insulating the interior side of basement walls to between R-5 and R-19 depending on where you live. Choose high-performance insulation products to achieve a greater R-value per inch, or stick with standard products to save money if space is not a concern.\nWear safety glasses and gloves to protect yourself when handling fiberglass insulation.\nNever install rigid foam products without covering them with 1/2-inch drywall. These materials release toxic fumes during a fire that could pose a significant health risk to your family.\nBeach, Emily. \"How to Insulate Basements.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/insulate-basements-8635.html.

    "text": "Location-based advertising (LBA) and marketing (LBM) could be of great benefit to local merchants, though there are some things that need to happen before widescale adoption of mobile campaigns will come about. Primarily, merchants need to know why mobile campaigns are beneficial to themselves and their target market, how to measure return on investment, and have access to smartphone owners regardless of application, device, or mobile platform.\nFor years, merchants have reached local customers through local daily and weekly print publications and other traditional media channels. However, with the growing number of smartphone users and the decrease of consumer use of print and other traditional media, merchants need another way to reach their target market. In many ways, smartphones and mobile devices such as the Apple iPad are an even better way to reach local customers, offering the ability for short-term, time-sensitive, location-based offers.\nConsider that mobile advertising is expected to be $7B+ market in the next four years, with LBA potentially having a significant slice of that. TheWhereBusiness.com outlined some of the current problems hampering LBA\u2019s growth, with one of the biggest being the relative lack of smartphone users to target. Be sure to take note of their explanation outlining the difference between LBA and LBM. This post, since it focuses only on local merchants, refers to a more general grouping of mobile campaign services, say LBAM (Location-Based Advertising and Marketing), as local merchants are less likely to make a distinction between the two terms.\nSure, there are a growing number of smartphone owners out there, but how many of them are using LBS (Location-Based Services) \u2014 aka location-sharing \u2014 apps such as Foursquare, MyTown, Gowalla, and dozens of others? There are many reasons people do not use location-sharing apps, including there really being no incentive to, beyond amusement. Why would merchants want to spend money on campaigns with little or no audience? Other issues that limit merchant use of LBAM include the lack of standards for running mobile campaigns, and the means of measuring ROI.\nCreate mobile campaign bellwethers. Applying the \u201claw of least resistance\u201d that humans tend to follow means that the average merchant is not going to adopt LBAM campaigns just because they can. They need to see the value. Someone or some group has to be a bellwether and define standards and metrics, create methods of measurement, define best-practices for mobile campaigns, run some successful campaigns, and then educate and influence anyone who can help propagate these standards. Then and only then will merchants start to buy into LBAM with confidence. When merchants start to make useful offers via mobile devices that appeal to consumers, word of mouth will also help spread the reasons for consumers to use LBS apps. E.g., most merchants know what a loss-leader is, when you offer something at a loss in a sale, in hopes of selling a shopper something at a greater profit margin. If merchants knew how to do that via mobile devices, they and consumers would both benefit.\nAgnostic channels: aggregation of apps and smartphone owners. Merchants want to reach consumers. They don\u2019t care which phone, mobile platform or LBS app a consumer is using. Otherwise there\u2019s just too much fragmentation. App-specificity might be part of Location-Based Marketing, but I think it\u2019s a bad idea from a local merchant point of view. Maybe if LBS apps developers teamed up to follow some open standards, a merchant would not have to create diffferent campaigns for different LBS apps.\nConsolidate ad networks. As with device/ app fragmentation, there\u2019s a similar problem with merchants having to deal with multiple networks. Ideally, merchants should just be able to go through some sort of mobile ads brokerage (maybe MobClix) that is platform- and ad network-agnostic in the sense that running campaigns become simplicity: setup your ad specifications, content and campaign details, then publish and measure. The less fragmentation of target market that merchants have access to, the sooner they\u2019re likely to adopt LBAM campaigns.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether any of these \u201cnecesssities\u201d are likely to happen anytime soon. Several big players, including Google and Apple, have their fingers in the mobile advertising pie and like to define things on their own terms. There are some consolidations of networks and companies going on in the LBA space, which might be ultimately beneficial. On a side note, based on recent patents that have been granted, namely iGroups and Concert Ticketing +, Apple seems to stand the best chance of implementing some powerful LBAM features into their iPhone platform, possibly via the recently announced iAds platform.",

Not much else to say really, just look at them!\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the world of modern American politics. Republican presidential hopeful Senator Lindsey Graham doesn\u2019t really want you to concern yourself with public policy decisions.\nRather, for some reason, he\u2019d have you more concerned with throwing in a dig at other hopeful and toup\u00e9d billionaire Donald Trump all while breaking old mobile phones.\nIt literally offers nothing else, but it\u2019s proving pretty popular online so if you like seeing a middle-aged, powerful white guy getting his teenage angst on, then look no further.\nCouldn\u2019t agree more with the title of this video, frankly. I\u2019m not sure where exactly it is but it\u2019s hard to imagine a more grim-looking backyard pool.\nAs always with fail videos, however, it has the gradual, slow build-up that all people love as he wets his feet (?) prior to his dive attempt and bigging himself up to the guy filming him.\nSo take note kids, an actual diving board is much better to use than a flimsy plastic chair.\nEating a hot dog at a baseball game is as American as you get, that is, unless you aren\u2019t really watching the game are failing at eating said hot dog.\nThis was the case for one kid at a baseball game who was caught on camera failing miserably at eating an adult-sized hot dog.\nEither way, watching a kid fail at eating a hot dog at a baseball game is arguably more entertaining than actually watching a baseball game.\nWatch out for his killer \u2018five second rule\u2019 skills.\nYo dawg, we hear you like rescuing drones so we got a drone to rescue your drone so you can have two drones.\nThis meme reference was brought you with the help of Harrisen Howes who as a drone pilot foolishly let one of his drunk friends fly one of his aircraft, who then ended up crashing it on a neighbour\u2019s roof.\nAnd this begins the most dramatic drone rescue of all time (probably) recruiting a bigger DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone to rescue the original Syma X5C, all to the music of soundtrack legend Hans Zimmer.\nFly drone, you\u2019re free now!\nThis week in \u2018when animals make weird noises we weren\u2019t expecting\u2019, a deer in Japan surprises American tourists with a weird noise we weren\u2019t expecting.\nIt sort of sounds like a curious fart noise, only for it to be followed up by some satanic scream that probably says something if you played it backwards.\nHonestly, the people\u2019s reactions to the deer is probably the best bit of the video, they really find it hilarious and I don\u2019t blame them.\nSeagulls. No one likes them and anyone who does must have a psychotic streak that enjoys seeing the scourge of skies rule our lives during the summer months.\nWell for one man and golfer, he\u2019s beginning (entirely by accident) a one-man crusade to end their dominance over the world, one golf swing at a time.\nAnd all it took was one really, really bad golf swing off the tee. \u201cYeah, he killed a bird\u201d, says one man behind the golfer who is truly the most observant type.\nWe don\u2019t know if the bird is actually dead, but we can be rest assured there\u2019s at least five to take its place.\nIn an orchestra, the sousaphone can add much needed oomph to the tinnier sound of the violin, but on its own, it becomes an instrument of hilarity.\nIn this case, a KKK rally in the US was thankfully interrupted by one anti-KKK protestor who brought their sousaphone, giving them some hilarious marching music.\nThe KKK crowd don\u2019t react, thankfully, but are clearly miffed by the send-off. Oh well.\nKudos Elvery Sports, you\u2019ve done good here. In its bid to sell more jerseys it\u2019s done some competition or whatnot, but to promote it it has hired Irish rugby star Simon Zebo to take on the role of John McClane from Die Hard in Try Hard.\nAdding a massive wedge of Irishness, Zebo fights off comedian Patrick McDonnell who plays the Hans Gruber role.\nWell, aside from Patrick actually, it\u2019s mostly filled with some rather entertaining acting from non-actors, which is usually worth a good laugh, and it\u2019s worth giving a watch.",

    "text": "Political surveys and their results consume a large part of the political discourse. Political officials at many different levels of government have come to rely on them as representing their constituents' preferences on current issues. However, research indicates surveys may have shortcomings which can affect valued democratic qualities (equality, for one). This brings into question their ability to accurately represent the public view. Many United States citizens do not feel that they can affect government actions. Voting is the citizen's domain, often after the candidates have been chosen.\nPolitical scientists have recognized and bemoaned the voter ignorance and apathy displayed prominently in survey research, but have for the most part ignored the causes. While they admit the shortcomings of surveys, they have not evaluated their use by politicians or attempted to measure surveys' effects relative to conceptions of democratic ideals within the broader society.\nThis thesis does not seek to establish our dependence on surveys as the origin of voter apathy; there are many contributing factors to political culture. It is the intention of this thesis to examine the shortcomings of surveys, how they are used, and the ways in which they result in undemocratic effects. A proposed plan for change is then introduced with the hope that it can remedy some of these ills.\nKagan, Nancy H., \"An Evaluation of Political Surveys and Their Consequences for Democracy\" (2009).

    "text": "Massachusetts has always been a source of innovative ideas that change the world, from the revolutionary principles that gave birth to democracy to the technological concepts that founded Facebook. But when it comes to our zoning, subdivision and planning laws, our state is still stuck a half century behind the curve.\nYet that could change. There is a growing movement to reform the state\u2019s antiquated and confusing laws that govern development. We aim to create a more predictable set of rules that will encourage good planning and good projects so that our cities and towns can enjoy the kinds of walkable, vibrant places where people want to live and work. To be successful, we need to pass legislation pending on Beacon Hill that will simplify the zoning process for the benefit of municipalities, residents, and property owners across MetroWest and throughout the Commonwealth.\nCurrent laws do not promote development that meets the needs of Massachusetts residents in 2013, much less in the years to come. We\u2019re building fewer than half of the homes needed to house current residents, and we\u2019re often building in ways that don\u2019t use our land and resources responsibly. It\u2019s time for some common sense that works in everyone\u2019s interests.\nKnown as House Bill 1859 or \u201cAn Act Promoting the Planning and Development of Sustainable Communities,\u201d our reform package has earned 58 co-sponsors since being introduced, including Sen. James Eldridge (D-Acton).\nThe proposal will make it quicker and cheaper for communities to decide where to sensibly grow by making master planning optional and more flexible. It encourages communities to establish districts for prompt permitting of housing and commercial growth while adopting environmental protections. With our proposal, the permitting process would become more rational for developers and the community. Instead of navigating a gamut of local boards individually, developers of major projects could submit a common application to all boards simultaneously and be granted a joint public hearing within 45 days of filing.\nLet\u2019s take development fights out of the courts. This bill brings our zoning law into the 21st century and clarifies many gray areas of the law so that everyone understands what they mean. A few examples include: inclusionary zoning to encourage affordable housing, impact fees to help offset the costs of development, and form-based codes that promote good design. Furthermore, we eliminate several loopholes that make it possible for developers or municipalities to game the system. Our legislation would create reasonable and standardized zoning protections once a building permit, special permit, or subdivision plan is approved. In the event of a disagreement on land use proposals, there will be an opportunity for a neutral facilitator to come in and settle the dispute instead of enduring costly and time-consuming court battles. The appeal process is streamlined to save everyone time and money.\nOur antiquated zoning laws hurt our environment as well. Every day in Massachusetts, 22 acres of forest and farmland are converted primarily to low-density residential sprawl. This is due in part to \u201cApproval Not Required\u201d (ANR) development, which is almost unregulated. We are the only state in the nation that allows this. Our reform proposal would enable a city or town to replace that ANR with an expedited review process to minimize haphazard development and preserve important landscapes in our communities. There are also provisions to encourage the sensitive placement of development as well as recharge our aquifers to reduce flooding.\nOne of Massachusetts\u2019 greatest strengths is the diversity of its cities and towns. There are dense urban areas like Somerville, seaside communities like Gloucester, and rural towns like Brimfield. Under these proposed new laws, MetroWest communities and cities and towns in all areas of the state will have the tools they need to lay out their vision for the future while preserving the character that makes them unique. Increasing our stock of moderately priced and affordable homes in a responsible, predictable manner will keep our talented residents here while attracting new people to Massachusetts, strengthening not only our individual towns but the entire Commonwealth.\nThe zoning reform bill is driven by the collective expertise of dozens of organizations including the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance, the Massachusetts Public Health Association, the City Solicitors and Town Counsel Association, the Massachusetts Association of Conservation Commissions, the Massachusetts Association of Planning Directors and many other groups that care about growth and quality of life in our communities.\nWe welcome a public discussion about how to improve development in Massachusetts and we invite you to learn more at the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance website and contact us. We hope you will agree that a more fair and predictable zoning and permitting process will create an attractive environment for investment in our state\u2019s great places.\nAndr\u00e9 Leroux is the executive director of the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance. State Senator Dan Wolf represents the Cape and the Islands.",

(SKS), which announced last month it is selling off its Proffitt&apos;s and McRae&apos;s department stores, on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter as its mid-price department-store business continues to languish.\nFor the first quarter ended April 30, income was $17.1 million, or 12 cents per share. The latest results include a gain of a penny per share from disposing of closed stores, offset by a penny per share related to expenses from an investigation of alleged improper collections of money from vendors at its Saks Fifth Avenue (search) division.\nOn average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting earnings of 16 cents per share in the latest quarter.\nSales totaled $1.55 billion, a slight 0.6 percent increase from $1.54 billion a year earlier and a bit below the $1.56 billion expected from Wall Street analysts.\nAt all of Saks&apos; stores open at least a year, sales grew 1.9 percent last quarter, with a 5.5 percent increase at Saks Fifth Avenue shops offsetting a 0.9 percent drop in its department-store group.\nSaks did not report its year-ago profit results because it expects to restate financial results for fiscal 1999 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 due to the investigation of markdown money and other related financial and accounting issues.\nMarkdown money is what suppliers pay to compensate stores when they don&apos;t sell products or are forced to take deeper markdowns than expected. Last week, the company announced it fired its chief accounting officer and other top officers as a result of the investigation.\nThe company, which is also the target of an informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission (search) and U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office in New York, said Tuesday it is working to confirm the amount of total vendor markdown allowances determined to have been improperly collected. As a result, all the results are preliminary and remain subject to change.\nLast month, Saks said it agreed to sell its Proffitt&apos;s (search) and McRae&apos;s department stores (search) to privately held retailer Belk Inc. for $622 million in cash. The stores have annual revenue of about $700 million. The company also said it&apos;s exploring strategic options for its northern mid-price department store division, which consist of 143 stores under the names of Carson, Pirie Scott, Bergner&apos;s, Boston Store, Younkers and Herberger&apos;s.\nShares of Saks fell 12 cents to $16.82 on the New York Stock Exchange.",

Danya Skolkin and Josh Tillis didn\u2019t pause to consider the ratio of precipitation to luck when skies turned ominous in the days just before their wedding last fall.\nBut on Aug. 25, as Ms. Skolkin and Mr. Tillis were finalizing the details of their Sept. 3 wedding in downtown Houston, Hurricane Harvey made landfall, ripping into that city and reaching its peak just before the college sweethearts and their more than 300 guests were about to celebrate.\nAt first they crossed their fingers, hoping the wedding would go on. But with six days to go and meteorologists in slickers deployed across the city issuing warnings about the devastation to come, Ms. Skolkin and Mr. Tillis, both 28, made the decision to postpone.\nBut she knew that what others faced in Houston was far more grave. Hundreds of thousands of Texas and Louisiana residents were displaced because of flooding.\nSo, with nothing to do but read the fine print on vendors\u2019 cancellation policies and watch Harvey\u2019s waters continue to rise, inspiration struck. After the roads cleared, the couple went to Aishel House, a Jewish nonprofit organization that offers shelter and warm meals to Houston hospital patients and their families. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even call, we just showed up, knowing they would be busy in this state of crisis,\u201d Ms. Skolkin said.\nMs. Skolkin and Mr. Tillis had planned to host a dinner for about 100 out-of-town guests at Aishel House that day. Instead of feeding their guests, they fed a three-course meal to 100 displaced local residents.\nThat particular event space is a special one for Ms. Skolkin and her family. Holly Harwood Skolkin, Ms. Skolkin\u2019s mother, was a founder of Aishel House. Ms. Harwood Skolkin was not able to see her daughter\u2019s selflessness. In 2012, she died of breast cancer after a 15-year struggle with a stage 4 diagnosis.\nWithin minutes, they were deboning and breading chicken breasts by the dozens.\nRochel Lazaroff, a co-director of the house, said Aishel House had already pre-ordered enough chicken breasts, brisket, salads, salmon and desserts to cater the couple\u2019s Shabbat welcome dinner for their long-distance wedding guests. The food, fortuitously, had arrived the week before.\n\u201cIt brought tears to our eyes,\u201d Ms. Skolkin said after she and Mr. Tillis realized how their postponed wedding plans would able to help their community in need.\nJust three months after Ms. Harwood Skolkin died, Mr. Tillis\u2019s father, Barry Tillis, died of lung cancer. Neither is sure they would have gotten engaged if their personal tragedies hadn\u2019t overlapped.\nMr. Tillis got to know Ms. Harwood Skolkin before she died, and Ms. Skolkin got to know Barry Tillis. The elder Mr. Tillis was an emotional father who never missed a youth sports event and cried at every one. \u201cPeople in our hometown still remember that about him,\u201d Mr. Tillis said.\nThat includes her daughter. \u201cWe were so close,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did all the stuff gals do, like shop and go out to eat. We were always laughing.\u201d Ms. Harwood Skolkin inspired her daughter\u2019s career as a nurse practitioner for heart failure patients; her mother\u2019s gratitude toward the nurses who helped her through cancer steered her toward nursing.\nMr. Tillis fell for Ms. Skolkin\u2019s good-heartedness and elegance. He also loves that she became, at his near insistence, a Denver Broncos football fan. By the time both graduated from the University of Texas and moved into a Houston high-rise together in 2015, they had established their own football tradition.\nMr. Tillis, a lifelong fan, is a demonstrative touchdown celebrator. \u201cI jump up and do a dance, I yell at the TV, I express my emotions physically,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t contain myself.\u201d Ms. Skolkin has taken to capturing his joyous displays covertly on camera. She has amassed a band of Snapchat followers who look forward to watching Mr. Tillis\u2019s outpourings of Broncos ebullience.\nOn Sept. 25, 2016, the day Mr. Tillis decided to propose, he made sure the Broncos were on.\n\u201cShe was sitting on the couch, just a normal Sunday, she\u2019s got no makeup on and we\u2019re just about to click on the TV,\u201d Mr. Tillis recalled. \u201cAfter the first big play I started running around the apartment like I usually do, and before she could grab her phone I went and grabbed a jersey I had bought her.\u201d The jersey said Tillis on the back. Mr. Tillis got down on one knee and asked if she would be his wife. Ms. Skolkin accepted the ring she recognized as her mother\u2019s \u2014 Dr. Skolkin had given it to Mr. Tillis in advance. She instantly accepted.\nOn Dec. 17, Ms. Skolkin walked down the aisle of the Marriott Houston ballroom, accompanied by her father. The bride wore a Martina Liana mermaid-style gown with pearl button detail up the back. Mr. Tillis, in a midnight blue tuxedo custom made in Thailand, met them beneath a stage set with a huppah. Rabbi Brian A. Strauss of Congregation Beth Yeshurun, and 340 guests, watched as Ms. Skolkin circled Mr. Tillis seven times, conveying unity and completeness, according to Jewish custom.\nAlthough Hurricane Harvey passed through Houston months ago, it was still fresh in the minds of attendees. Rabbi Strauss said his synagogue suffered about $6 million in damage from the storm. He took heart in learning he would be marrying a generous and kind couple.\nIn their vows, which the couple read to each other before the traditional breaking of the glass, both remembered their late parents.\n\u201cYou have shown me that even life\u2019s hardest, most confusing times can result in the most beautiful clarity,\u201d Ms. Skolkin said as two maids of honor, a best man, 10 bridesmaids, 11 groomsmen and five ushers stood by them.\nIn his vows, Mr. Tillis said his father used to pepper him with questions about what he was looking for in a woman, and he would give his answers: \u201cSmart, funny, pretty, strong Jewish identity.\u201d His father thought these were good qualities, but told the younger Mr. Tillis that most important in a partner is a good heart.\nHe saw just that when Ms. Skolkin fed, bathed and clothed her mother, and kept her spirits up. Ms. Harwood Skolkin, in the late stages of her illness, once grabbed Mr. Tillis by the arm and told him Ms. Skolkin was her \u201cberakah\u201d \u2014 Hebrew for blessing.\nCome rain or come shine, both knew how lucky they were \u2014 on their second planned wedding day \u2014 to have found each other.\nPaul DeBenedetto contributed reporting from Houston.\nHouston Serenade The reception, also at the Marriott, opened with a first dance to \u201cHome\u201d by Michael Bubl\u00e9, then transitioned into a choreographed wedding party dance to Flo Rida\u2019s \u201cMy House\u201d; the music was a mix between a D.J. and an Austin wedding band, the Matchmaker Band.\nField and Flowers Both a bride\u2019s and groom\u2019s cake were served during the reception. For her cake, Ms. Skolkin chose a four-tier buttercream confection with fondant flowers and gold accents. Mr. Tillis\u2019s cake was more reflective of his passion for the Denver Broncos. A double-chocolate cake made to look like a football field.",

    "text": "Before Baby Lo was born earlier this month, we weren't sure if Chris Lopez would be a huge part of his life ... until he showed up at the hospital to be there for Kailyn Lowry when she gave birth. Unfortunately, though, it seems like there's a chance everything has changed. Reportedly, Chris has bailed on Kail and Baby Lo. What?!\nAccording to what a friend of the Teen Mom 2 mama told Hollywood Life, Chris isn't there for the baby like Kailyn thought he'd be after he showed up to the hospital to be there when the baby was born ... and it's really not looking good for the future.\n\"Kail's relationship with Chris has been like a rollercoaster -- full of ups and downs and unexpected turns. After he showed up for the delivery and drove them home from the hospital, Kailyn thought there was going to be a good chance he would actually be in his son's life. He even made the effort to visit a few times, with gifts for the baby. But just as Kailyn started believing that Chris may actually be committed to being a dad, he bails.\"\nOh no! That sounds like a miserable thing to deal with when you're juggling life with a newborn (and two kids!) as a single mom.\nWe're not convinced this story is true, though. Just recently, Chris was on Twitter, talking about how much he loves hanging out with his son, so if he's not lying, we'd take that to mean that he has no plans of bailing -- and hasn't so far.\n\"It's one thing if he dips in and out of her life, but it's not OK to do that to a child. Right now, she's one step away from cutting Chris out of her life completely, as she can't help but think having no father is better than having one who constantly upsets, hurts, and bails on his child.\"\nWe hope everything works out for these two ... for Baby Lo's sake, anyway.",

Pleasant, horticulture, who has served two terms as director of AIP. AIP\u2019s current location includes a conference room, rooms for undergraduate and graduate student use and offices for the program\u2019s staff and faculty.\nCo-chair of NASAC Jake Swamp \u201911 said the proximity of the Kennedy Hall offices to Call Auditorium and the Trillium dining facility would jeopardize the quiet and relaxed atmosphere of the AIP center in Caldwell.\n\u201cThis [move] would serve to both split up the students, faculty and staff who constantly run into each other and form a cohesive community,\u201d Swamp said.\nThe Caldwell center serves as an academic and community hub for students involved in AIP, Cheyfitz said.\nAlumni and current students echo Cheyfitz\u2019s description of a strong Native American community in AIP.\nSpeaking on the issue of safe spaces for marginalized communities on campus, Cheyfitz discussed the importance of the Africana Center, the Asian American Studies Program and the Latino Studies Program. The latter two share a space on the fourth floor of Rockefeller Hall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for all the ethnic studies programs to have contained space where students can get away from stresses of the day,\u201d Cheyfitz said.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said students and faculty first received notification of the proposed move on Tuesday. In fact, members of the AIP community were notified of the proposal on Feb. 1. The Sun regrets this error.",

As of early morning on Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin went down to around $500 across major exchanges, its lowest in nearly a month.\nTwo weeks ago, China's central bank said Bitcoin was not a currency and thus prohibited local financial institutions from processing bitcoin transaction. Now, the central bank has banned third-party payment companies from dealing in bitcoins, as reported by multiple news outlets.\nAs a result of these regulations, which put into question the viability of Bitcoin as a currency in China, the global price of Bitcoin has dipped to less than $500, after it hit $1,000 just three weeks ago.\nThe chart below, from Blockchain.info, shows the plunge in Bitcoin price as a result of China's clampdown.\nOn Tuesday, the People's Bank of China asked 10 of the largest Chinese third-party payment companies, which account for half of all online transactions in China, to stop dealing in Bitcoin, according to local news reports, a move that will effectively block new deposits of bitcoin into local exchanges.\nBTC China, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, confirmed on Wednesday with a post on its official Sina Weibo account that it would no longer accept deposits in the Chinese currency yuan, as a result of the latest ban.\n\"For reasons we all know, BTC China has had to cease renminbi [yuan] account charging functions,\" BTC China announced, according to The New York Times.\nBTC China's co-founder Bobby Lee later confirmed the news to the Financial Times. \"As of right now, we have received notice from our third-party payment company that they will disallow customers from making deposits into our exchange,\" he said.\nThe announcement sent the price of Bitcoin down $200 in less than 24 hours, as Techinasia reported.\nWith financial institutions banned from processing bitcoin transactions and with this new ban on bitcoin deposits through third party vendors, it is now virtually impossible for Chinese Bitcoin users to buy new bitcoins.\nThe price of Bitcoin skyrocketed last month in large part due to Chinese users flocking to buy the cryptocurrency and jumping on its global bandwagon. These latest bad news might cause Bitcoin prices to keep dipping, making Cameron Winklevoss' prediction that Bitcoin might hit $40,000 even more unlikely to ever come true.",

    "text": "If Venus were a melody, it would not be a lyrical flute line followed by violin and cello solos. Gustav Holst got it wrong when he composed his famous suite, The Planets.\nVenus is anything but lovely. It's more like a furnace with sulfur clouds and crushing atmospheric pressure.\nAnd Graf can't have rookie astronomical mistakes if he is to conduct The Planets in NASA's hometown. So the Houston Symphony decided to fix the problem. Or at least turn the problem into art.\nWith the help of filmmaker Duncan Copp and state-of-the-art space images, the Houston Symphony has created The Planets \u2014 An HD Odyssey. The production is a musical and visual performance piece that features a high-definition movie of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and the other movements of Holst's suite.\nThe new movie debuts Thursday in Jones Hall in a live Houston Symphony concert of the work. Performances continue next weekend before the orchestra takes its new production to Florida and New York City's Carnegie Hall.\nThe new movie was commissioned by the Houston Symphony and created by Copp, the London-based producer of the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, which told the story of the Apollo astronauts.\nIn addition to the live performances, the Houston Symphony created a DVD of the movie and music for sofa-side viewing. Graf also expects the movie to be used by other symphonies in live performances.\nThough recognized as a powerful combination, pictures in the concert hall have been met with enthusiasm and criticism.\nIt's not new in Houston.\nSince 2005, the Houston Symphony has hung big screens in Jones Hall for some of its performances, projecting closeups of musicians just like on television. Graf conducted Richard Strauss' Alpine Symphony in 2008 set against images of a hike in the Alps. Recently, piano superstar Leif Ove Andsnes launched a project combining new visual works set to Mussorgksy's Pictures at an Exhibition that he performed in Houston and other cities.\nThough many found Andsnes' project riveting and a sign of classical music's visual future, critics complained that the images distracted from the beauty of the music and the pianist's performance.\nAdding images to musical performance is not for all occasions, Graf said. Bach or Beethoven might be better left unadorned, he said.\nIn a world increasingly glued to television, computer, movie and phone screens, it makes sense for the Houston Symphony to present a program such as The Planets \u2014 An HD Odyssey, said Dave Kirk, Houston Symphony principal tuba player.\nThe project, Kirk said, also has ignited interest in the Houston community. Ticket sales prove him right. The Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon shows were sold out more than a week before the performances. One of the last times the 2,100 seats were filled was for a concert of music including Star Wars.\n\u201cAnything that increases people's awareness of what we do as an orchestra helps us artistically,\u201d said Kirk.\nThe Planets lends itself to the project. It is one of the war horses of orchestra repertoire and a \u201cgateway\u201d to classical music for many a listener,\u201d Kirk said.\nHolst's broad and dramatic melodies are played by a huge orchestra, fortified by extra woodwinds, brass and a chorus that commands attention. Even though the Mars movement is difficult rhythmically, many a marching band has taken it onto the field. The suite is often paired with images from space.\nWhen Holst wrote the piece in 1914, he was not describing the planets musically, but the gods of their names. Mars he called \u201cthe Bringer of War\u201d and Venus, \u201cthe Bringer of Peace,\u201d for example.\nThe new movie offers a visual correction to Holst's astrological ideas of space.\nThe idea came about after a performance of Holst in 2003 that was accompanied by old planet images, Graf said. Some astronauts on stage for the show were less than impressed with the visual part of the performance, Graf said.\nThe symphony hired Copp to help.\nThe filmmaker, whose doctoral work examined the volcanic and geologic processes of Venus, pieced together the state-of-the-art images into a high-definition movie coordinated with Holst's music.\nThe digital images come from NASA spacecraft. They are mostly in the public domain, Copp said, though most have never been seen by the public.\nIn Copp's movie, the graphics of Saturn are molded to give the viewer the sense of tilting of the planet's rings with the movement of the spacecraft.",

    "text": "One bad day on the street and Mike Suznevich concludes that there's something wrong with human kindness: Not enough of it to go around. What can I tell you? The guy drives for a living -- he drives mainly sedans-for-hire -- and he hasn't been doing this for very long. \"About a month and a half,\" he says in a New Jersey accent that makes him sound tougher than he really is. Two incidents in one day left Mike smarting from a compound fracture of his faith in mankind.\nLast Wednesday morning, he stopped the car he drives for On-Time Sedan Service at the corner of Light and Pratt, near the Bell Atlantic building. His passenger was a woman who is legally blind.\nVisually handicapped Baltimoreans frequently use On-Time because they find the sedan service more reliable, albeit more expensive, than public transportation or cabs. After Mike stopped the car and opened the door, his passenger remained in the car to write a check to cover her fare. Then she gathered up her belongings. Apparently this took more time than a certain city traffic officer wanted to allow.\nAs his passenger walked off, Mike turned around and the officer handed him a $32 ticket for parking in a no-stopping zone. \"She [the officer] didn't warn me, didn't speak to me, didn't say a word,\" Mike says. \"When I tried to explain how my passenger needed time getting out of the car, [the officer] didn't want to hear it. . . . But, that's not all. Let me tell you what happened the same day at the airport, in the afternoon.\"\n\"It was hot, it was humid, it was like 100 degrees. The [cabbie] says, 'I don't give. . . . It's my cab stand.' I said, 'What kind of a human being are you? . . .' I say it's 50-50 out there. A 50 percent chance you'll run into someone who cares, 50 percent that you'll run into someone who doesn't.\" I say he's being optimistic.\nWhat do you think the standard restaurant mark-up of wine is? Two hundred percent over wholesale? Three hundred percent?\nThrough Labor Day, Spike & Charlie's is offering bottles of wine at -- get this -- just a dollar over cost. The Cathedral Street restaurant and wine bar has come up with a \"dog days\" list that, management claims, doesn't contain any dogs.\nTo make sure, I checked with two experts not easily impressed and they were easily impressed. Neither ever heard of a restaurant making such an offer. An Aujoux Beaujolais 1993 for $7 looks good, and one of my consultants likes the $14 bottle of Muller Catoir Riesling Kabinett Halbtrocken 'Mussbacher Eselshaut' 1992, which should get three stars just for its name.\nNick: \"Mom, do we have a lawyer?\"\nNick: \"Because we have a phone, and the TV says if we have a phone we have a lawyer.\"\n\"If you have a phone, you have a lawyer\" is the time-worn advertisement for Saiontz & Kirk. Put a twist on the phrase -- \"If you're a lawyer, you need a phone\" -- and you have a possible title for a dispute involving two Baltimore attorneys.\nRonald M. Sharrow and Daniel Cohen are fussing over a phone number. In fact, they've hired lawyers to do the fussing. Cohen and Sharrow, well-known as a pioneer in lawyer advertising, began a contractual association in 1991. Cohen had more than three decades of experience, numerous contacts and clients, and a phone number, 539-0063, of many years.\nThe phone number was important to Cohen. A phone number is important to all lawyers. \"It's your lifeline,\" one remarked yesterday.\nSharrow's attorney, Richard Rosenthal, says Cohen agreed to relinquish his phone number at the end of this three-year association with the Sharrow law firm. But early this year, Cohen decided not to retire at the end of his stint and to return to private practice on his own. And he wanted to take his more than 30-year-old phone number with him.\nNo way, said Sharrow. Cohen offered to buy the number back. Sharrow insisted a deal was a deal and went to court to keep Cohen from using 539-0063. Last Friday, Baltimore Circuit Judge Edward J. Angeletti granted Sharrow's request for an injunction, ordered that Cohen no longer use 539-0063 and that it be transferred to Sharrow. This week, a former federal judge, James R. Miller Jr., will serve as arbiter as the two sides hash it out. Meanwhile, if you're looking for Cohen, his number now is 547-0480.\nAh, summer. Late summer. Soon we'll have more zucchini than anyone wants to be associated with.\nWrite me at: This Just In, 501 N. Calvert St., Baltimore 21278. Or call 332-6166.",

    "text": "Making a proper plate of com tam Vietnamese broken rice does not come easily, even to experienced local chefs.\nThe dish, a typical specialty of South Vietnam, made from cheaper \"broken rice,\"\u009d most commonly goes with a grilled pork chop, a fried egg, shredded pork skin and a pork-egg custard alongside pickled vegetables (usually carrots and parsnips, but sometimes also cucumbers and cabbage).\nThe dish is accompanied with super-sweet fish sauce and chili that northerners and people from the central region sometimes have a hard time getting down because of all the sugar.\nBut German Ralph Ludwig, who comes from Augsburg City in South Germany, has had no problem eating plate upon plate of the stuff. He fell in love with the dish so deeply that he now sells it at his own Com Tam Ba Son Restaurant.\nOpened in Ho Chi Minh City eight weeks ago, the venture has been successful so far.\nHis wife's family has been selling com tam in the Mekong Delta province of Dong Thap for decades. His uncle-in-law is still running the original Com Tam Ba Son Restaurant there.\n\"It's not a franchise. It's a family business,\"\u009d Ludwig says.\nBefore coming up with the restaurant idea, he was thinking of retiring after 10 years of doing businesses in Vietnam.\nFor the first six years, he worked for Siemens group, an electronics giant from Germany, as CEO of the Communications Division. He looked after branches in Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan and South Korea from HCMC.\nHe was then appointed the position of CEO of Communications for China. The job required him and his wife to move to Hong Kong.\nThey lived there for fourteen months but they did not like the life there, so they returned and he started his new job in 2010 as General Director of the Schindler Ltd. Vietnam, specializing in elevator and escalator equipment sales.\nBut he decided to step out of the executive management last year and knew that he would need to do something to keep himself busy if he were to retire.\nThe idea of opening the com tam restaurant came from his wife.\nThey called their parents for help and chose the Phu My Hung urban area in District 7 because Ludwig wanted to have a clean environment and a location that would attract foreign customers.\n\"I know they want to see a foreign face, and maybe they feel more confident about the food,\"\u009d he says.\nTran Thi Hong Hoa, his mother-in-law, has moved to the city to help out. She too was thinking about retiring, but she can't get enough of selling com tam.\nHoa now takes care of the kitchen as the main cook. Ludwig is in charge of management.\nSpeaking about his strategy to compete with the city's thousands of com tam shops, Ludwig said firmly that what makes people keep coming back to his place is the quality of the food, the restaurant's environment as well as its service.\nAs a businessman, he knows how to make \"Com Tam Ba Son\"\u009d a famous brand. \"To develop a brand, we need to have sustainable quality,\"\u009d he says.\nHe says that along with quality ingredients, it's cleanliness - from the table to the kitchen to the restroom - is the primary standard at his restaurant.\n\"Clean, very clean, and professional as much as possible. We've also trained our waiters and waitresses very carefully to make sure they bring good service,\"\u009d he said.\nHe said the prices were a bit high because of the quality of the meat.\nApart from com tam, Ludwig's Com Tam Ba Son also offers a few German specialties: sausages and beer.\n\"Vietnamese can eat com tam everyday, but foreigners cannot,\"\u009d he says.\nLudwig is also super proud of the homemade lasagna he makes himself and sells at the shop. He smiles brightly as he shows it off, like a child happy with a major achievement.\nThe best thing about Com Tam Ba Son is the secrete meat marinade and fish sauce made with his mother-in-law's family recipe, handed down from generation to generation.\nLudwig's favorite \"funny and surprising story\"\u009d from his shop is about the day a group of Vietnamese people on motorbikes stopped at his place and ordered some com tam to take away.\nThey looked at the menu prices of around VND55,000-70,000 per dish of com tam, and complained that the price was too high, and that they could have the same com tam at half of those prices at a place not very far from there.\nBut they decided to try Ludwig's com tam, and now they come back almost every day.\nOnly two among his 15 waiters and waitresses speak good English so he and his wife are there to help foreigners.\nkeep themselves busy. What I like more in Vietnam is that we always have a lot of business opportunities. If you have some particular good idea, and you are keen on it, you can easily get success,\"\u009d he said.\nAt the moment, Ludwig still runs his own company in Germany apart from Com Tam Ba Son, but he spends almost all his time in Vietnam and just looks out for that company via phone or email through a general director over there.",

    "text": "Jewel Samad/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Melody C. Barnes preparing to play golf with President Obama on Sunday in Fort Belvoir, Va.\nMelody C. Barnes, a White House aide, broke through President Obama\u2019s green ceiling Sunday afternoon.\nMs. Barnes, the president\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser, became the first woman to play a round of golf with Mr. Obama since he tee\u2019d off his presidency in January. The milestone is noteworthy as Mr. Obama has come under criticism recently for hosting a basketball game earlier this month for members of his cabinet and congress that included no women (\u201cBunk,\u201d Mr. Obama told NBC in an interview last week when asked about the controversy over the estrogen-free game).\nShortly after 1 p.m. on a crisp and sunny fall afternoon, Mr. Obama and Ms. Barnes took to the links at the U.S Army\u2019s Fort Belvoir in Virginia. The president wore a black short-sleeve shirt while Ms. Barnes donned a baseball cap and a dark long-sleeve shirt, according to a White House pool report prepared by Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times.\nIt was not immediately known what Mr. Obama and Ms. Barnes shot on Sunday.\nThis story is \u201cBunk\u201d! Having a slow news day, New York Times?\nWhen it came to having women in the inner circle, Obama talks a good game but W walked it where O merely talks it.\nWho cares? I like to play golf with the guys just to be a guy\u2026 talk sports, have a beer, tell off-color jokes. The President (any president) has to spend all day being PC and inclusive with the pressure of providing for a nation of people, fighting two wars, and dealing with global crises. Let the guy play some basketball with the guys or pick his Sunday foursome with whomever he wants. Yeesh\u2026 this is NOT news.\nI thought the Silly Season ended on Labor Day.\nI hope she didn\u2019t \u201clet him\u201d win!\nI think Obama has long since proved his bona fides as a strong feminist.\nBut does the absurd media coverage the all-male basketball game has received mean that every time Obama moves a muscle, it wlll be scrutinized for politically correctness according to extreme feminists???\nWell, I am certainly confident that anyone who considers the all-male basketball game to be serious evidence of Obama\u2019s sexism would never condone a bunch of women getting together without a male present .\nWhat is this, cable? I read the Times to get away from this silliness.\nSeriously? Who cares who he plays golf with? Who cares what kind of clothes he or his guest was wearing? You would think the New York Times would have more to report on with two wars going on and Obama\u2019s rating in the toilet.\nI\u2019ve always been a tomboy\u2026sports fan, more comfortable hanging with the guys. I totally understand the bond amongst men, often centered around beer, sports, cigars (i.e. fun stuff!). It\u2019s a wonderful thing, just like the unique bond amongst women. The problem arises when work and important decisions are made during these all-male activities, whether intentional or not. I don\u2019t know what to say ladies\u2026take up golf I suppose.\nUnbelievable. This is \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d without common sense. Dangerous.\nI am ok if there are baby showers were just women are invited, I am ok if there are sports team only for girls, I am ok if there are bathrooms only for women, and I am ok if the President chooses to play sports with men. People can read way too much into things, and forget context, common sense, perspective and also a bit of humor.\nHonestly, if the original story had not been on the front page, I would have thought it was a story from The Onion. I guess when the media is on a quest to find fault with someone, all areas are open.\nShouldn\u2019t Obama first decide about troops in Afghainstan before he takes time off to play golf?\nmy father made me take golf lessons during junior high school and high school \u2013 he said it was for my future. he was right\u2026 once the office found out that i played golf, i was invited to play with the \u201cguys.\u201d it\u2019s true\u2026 a lot of work issues are discussed during a game \u2013 i don\u2019t think it\u2019s intentional but it happens.\nYeah, John Drew, just like it\u2019s a lot easier to be a right wing Christian if you don\u2019t apply all those silly principles to your own life\u2013you know, the ones about feeding the poor, loving your neighbor, and all that nonesense.\nOh, puh-leeeze. Is there really nothing else to talk about?\nMany times men are establishing relationships that further their careers when they get togther in activites such as these. Decisions are often made in such settings. If the all male club is sustained, women are put at a disadvantage. The people invited to such events are often the real inner circle. When women are excluded, they are put at a disadvantage.\nIf HRC had been elected president, how would men like it if she only invited women to all social functions and shut out men? My question is hypothetical since HRC did not win, but it would be interesting to see men\u2019s reactions to such a scenario.\nFor all of Obama\u2019s talk, I do think he harbors sexist attitudes.\n\u201cWhen it came to having women in the inner circle, Obama talks a good game but W walked it where O merely talks it.\nIn response to Liz: If you are playing golf with people who are talking about work you aren\u2019t really playing golf.\nFirst of all, obviously the president and his staff seems to have realized that this is a problem. Why else, all of a sudden, Melody Barnes is playing golf with him?\nSecond, to all those people dismissing this story: it\u2019s not \u201cjust\u201d a basketball game. Things like these might seem harmless on the surface, but can actually have a deleterious effect on women\u2019s upward movement in the workplace. It is exactly these kinds of informal, male networks that can give men the edge, when it comes time for performance reviews, bonuses, allocation of juicy assignments, promotions, etc.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that men aren\u2019t allowed to play basketball anymore. It just means that corporate bosses need to be a lot of more sensitive about organizing after-work activities that are inclusive of everyone. If that means that you don\u2019t play basketball with your office, but with an external community league, so be it. It won\u2019t be the end of the world. Being an egalitarian leader means having to make some sacrifices.\nGood for both of them.\nWe women who golf learned a long time ago that it helps solidify relationships, make men more comfortable off the course, and allows boht players to witness outside the office what we should already know from inside the office \u2013 namely, how people behave when things go your way \u2013 and when they don\u2019t. Is it with honesty, humility, humor, and strength? It\u2019s a great litmus test for any relationship, professional and personal. Good for President Obama for opening up the game.\nWhat Obama organized is a text book example of a boys-only club.\nThe president is never \u201coff duty,\u201d particularly when interacting with his employees.\nEvery moment of the president\u2019s day is scheduled. An opportunity to spend time with him is precious to anyone who wants to have an influence on public policy. That\u2019s why some people spend tens \u2013 if not hundreds \u2013 of thousands of dollars to play a round with him. This is Politics 101.\nEvery nay-saying commenter here acknowledged that these games help the president bond with his staff and other advisors. Bonding with your boss is important. Women deserve an equal opportunity to do this.\nIf you don\u2019t think its a problem that, after 22 golf games and numerous basketball games, NO women \u2013 until now \u2013 were given an equal opportunity to get face time and bond with the president, you are both a sexist and an ignoramus.\nAnd don\u2019t fool yourselves \u2013 if a president Hillary Clinton organized 22+ golf games and a dozen bridge games and didn\u2019t invite any male staff, you male reporters and pundits and commenters would be shrieking with outrage. You\u2019d be crying about man-hating and calling for her impeachment. Admit it.\nWe do NOT need a White House modeled on Mad Men. If that\u2019s the change B. has in mind, he can stuff it.",

The forward made his feelings clear after his heroics at Goodison Park, and agent Alex Gontran suggested the player would have to consider his options if he was dropped again.\nPardew said: \"There has just been so much nonsense written about it. His agent sent me an e-mail saying he was misquoted, and I actually believe him. I am not usually one to believe agents that much, but I do believe him on this occasion, and I also think Demba's anger has been generated in the right way - to improve for Newcastle United.\"\nHe added: \"There is no way that Demba can play every game this season. He is going to miss some other games - so will Shola [Ameobi] and so will Papiss [Cisse].\n\"The best thing we can do is try to play the best players we have and get a win, and Demba led from start to finish - not just his goal - in the dressing room, everything about him was top drawer.\"\nBa's 19th-minute strike, his fourth of the season, ultimately secured just Newcastle's second league victory of the campaign, although a series of other chances went begging with Cisse missing from the penalty spot.\nNorwich, who also went close through Wes Hoolahan and Robert Snodgrass, might have been level had Steve Harper not made a vital 47th-minute block from Andrew Surman.\nFor Canaries boss Chris Hughton, who was given a warm welcome back to Tyneside by Newcastle fans grateful for the job he did there in the wake of relegation from the top flight, there were positives despite the ongoing wait for a first league win of the season.\nHe said: \"It was always one that I was looking forward to. The reception was excellent and I was absolutely delighted with that.\n\"What I wanted it to be was an even better day, and an even better day would have been for us to get a result that I think, on the balance of play as the away team, we probably deserved.\"",

His IT organization has been winning awards for technology innovation since the early 2000s, and Richardville has received CIO of the Year awards from the Charlotte CIO Leadership Association, College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).\nHow does Richardville and his team manage to drive innovation in an industry that has been a relative laggard in adopting new technologies?\nA case in point: When Richardville received his electric bill from Duke Energy, he saw the bill gave advice on how to lower his family\u2019s electricity costs. He talked with Duke\u2019s CIO about the systems and processes behind that product and introduced the same capability to Carolinas HealthCare System.\nLikewise, Richardville is currently in talks with the CIO of a pillow manufacturer about how Internet of Things (IoT) technologies might allow both companies to innovate.\nWhile \u201cconnected pillows\u201d are only in the early discussion phase, Richardville and his team have plenty of innovative projects in development.\nPatients can use Alexa to learn wait times at Carolinas HealthCare System\u2019s nearest urgent care centers and then reserve their spot in line.\n\u201cOur goal is that patients will be able to use voice for any online services they are currently using, whether that\u2019s scheduling appointments or paying bills,\u201d says Richardville.\nHow did the IT team at Carolinas Healthcare System get the voice initiative going?\nRichardville says there are several new leadership skills, such as innovation and lean thinking, that should not be siloed departments, but rather weaved into the fabric of core business leadership.\n\u201cInnovation does not belong to one group here.

With many IS leaders having already retreated from Mosul, Ansary's death comes as blow to the militants as they defend their shrinking area of control street-by-street and house-by-house.\nCapturing the Iron Bridge would mean Iraqi forces hold three of the five bridges in Mosul that span the Tigris, all of which have been damaged by the militants and U.S.-led air strikes. The southernmost two have already been retaken.\n\"We are still moving toward the Iron Bridge. We are taking out snipers hiding in the surrounding building, we are still pushing for the Iron Bridge,\" Brigadier General Mahdi Abbas Abdullah of the Rapid Response force told Reuters.\nNear the Mosul Museum, Iraq forces used armored vehicles and tanks to attack snipers pinning down troops clearing areas around the bridge.\nAn air strike targeting one Islamic State position hit a building, engulfing nearby troops in smoke and dust.\nSince starting the offensive in October, Iraqi forces with U.S.-led coalition support have retaken eastern Mosul and about 30 percent of the west from the militants, who are outnumbered but fiercely defending their last stronghold in Iraq.\nFor much of Tuesday, the troops were within 100m (330 feet) of the bridge.\n\"It's very key for our forces to secure the riverside and prevent Daesh militants from turning around our advancing forces,\" a Rapid Response spokesman said in the morning, using an Arab acronym for Islamic State.\nThey expected to gain control of the Iron Bridge and the nearby area by the end of the day, he said.\n\"Seizing the bridge will help further tighten the noose around Daesh fighters entrenched inside the old city,\" he said.\nThe boom of shelling and heavy machinegun fire could be heard from the center of Mosul and helicopter gunships strafed the ground from above on Tuesday morning.\nAmid the combat, a steady stream of refugees trudged out of the western districts, carrying suitcases, bottles of water and other possessions. Some pushed children and sick elderly relatives in handcarts and wheelbarrows.\nSoldiers packed them into trucks on the Mosul-Baghdad highway to be taken to processing areas. Most left in the dark early morning hours or after the army recaptured their neighborhoods. Food had been scarce, they said.\n\"We fled at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT) after the army had arrived. There has been a lot of shelling by Daesh,\" said Hamid Hadi, a teacher. \"Mostly we've been eating water mixed with tomatoes.\"\nAshraf Ali, a nurse who escaped with his wife and two children, said mortar rounds were falling as they fled. They took advantage of the army retaking their district to get out.\n\"Daesh wanted us to move to their areas but we escaped when the army arrived,\" he said.\nAs many as 600,000 civilians are caught with the militants inside Mosul, which Iraqi forces have effectively sealed off from the remaining territory that Islamic State controls in Iraq and Syria. The Iraqi forces include army, special forces, Kurdish peshmerga and Shi'ite militias.\nMore than 200,000 Mosul residents have been displaced since the start of the campaign in October. The Ministry of Immigration and Displacement said on Tuesday that in recent days, almost 13,000 displaced people from western Mosul had been received seeking assistance and temporary accommodation each day.\n\"Whenever we advance there are more people coming out,\" said one Iraqi officer directing refugee transport. \"There are more people on this side of the city and people are trying to leave because there is no food and no supplies in their area.\"\nLosing Mosul would be a major strike against Islamic State. It is by far the largest city the militants have held since their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed himself leader of a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria from a mosque in Mosul in the summer of 2014.",

    "text": "In 1890, a group of eight large New York City bakeries combined to form the New York Biscuit Company and built a giant six-story factory in West Chelsea. Eight years later, they merged with their competitor, Chicago's American Biscuit and Manufacturing to form an even larger conglomerate \u2013 the National Biscuit Company, but the factory and headquarters remained in Chelsea. In 1901, the National Biscuit Company put their abbreviated company name on a box of wafers for the first time \u2013 Nabisco. Soon, Nabisco became the company's official name.\nOn April 2, 1912, the National Biscuit Company announced to their sales team that they were introducing three \"highest class biscuits,\" in a grouping they called the \"Trio.\" Two of the cookies, the Mother Goose Biscuit and Veronese Biscuit, didn't sell particularly well and quickly disappeared from the shelves. The third, the Oreo Biscuit, did. \"Two beautifully embossed chocolate-flavored wafers with a rich cream filling,\" the Oreo Biscuit was sold in a yellow tin with a glass cover for approximately 30 cents a pound (about $7.13 today). While it went national in April, it was just a month before that the National Biscuit Company first registered the product with the US Patent and Trademark Office (registration number 0093009). It is commonly stated the given date of registration was March 6th, which is why that is National Oreo Day. However, a simple patent and trademark search reveals that oft-repeated date is incorrect. In fact, it was actually filed on March 14, 1912 and registered on August 12, 1913.\nSo how did they come up with the idea of the Oreo? By using the time-honored business practice of stealing the idea from a competitor and then marketing it better than the original. You see, there was another popular creme-filled sandwich cookie that came before the Oreo, made by Sunshine Biscuits. Sunshine Biscuits was a company run by Joseph and Jacob Loose and John H. Wiles, the former of which were originally part of the great bakery conglomeration of 1898 (the one that formed into the National Biscuit Company).\nIn any event, in 1908, four years before the Oreo, Sunshine debuted the upscale, and soon to be very popular, Hydrox biscuit, which the Oreo was a pretty blatant rip-off of, cream filling, embossing and all. Of course, Nabisco denies this is where the idea for the Oreo came from, but the evidence at hand strongly indicates otherwise.\nAs for the name, there has never been a firm answer for why the National Biscuit Company chose \"Oreo,\" though there are several theories. There is speculation that \"Oreo\" is derived from the French word for gold \u2013 \"or,\" since the original packing was gold and the item was meant to be a \"high-class\" confectionery. It could also come from the Greek word for mountain or mound \u2013 \"oros,\" since an Oreo is a \"mountain\" of a cookie. It has also been speculated that maybe it was named for the cookie itself, two \"O\" shape cookies sandwiching the cream, O-cream-O.\nThe identity of the designer behind the distinctive emboss on top of each cookie \u2013 or what the emboss signifies \u2013 has also become part of the Oreo mystery. The first design was simple enough \u2013 with the name \"Oreo\" and a wreath at the edge. In 1924, the company augmented the original design to go with a 1921 name tweak \u2013 from \"Oreo Biscuit\" to \"Oreo Sandwich.\" The 1924 design added a ring of laurels and two turtledoves. Twenty years later, in 1952, is when today's elaborate, beautiful, design first appeared.\nBut what does the design signify, if anything? Historians believe the circle that encases the word \"oreo\" with antenna-type symbol on top was an early European symbol for quality. Cookie conspiracists believe that the antenna symbol is actually a Cross of Lorraine, a symbol identified with the famed Knights Templar. The \"four-leaf clovers\" that surround the name could be just that or it could be the cross pattee \u2013 a geometric pattern of four triangles radiating outwards that is also associated with the Knights Templar and the Freemasons. It's up to the individual what they want to believe, but this author thinks the Oreo cookie is a delicious Da Vinci Code style map leading to a treasure buried a thousand years ago\u2026 Or as I like to call it, the probable plot to National Treasure 3.\nNow, who designed the emboss? Evidence points to William Turnier. However, while Nabisco admits that a man by the name of William Turnier worked for them for fifty years, they deny that he developed the 1954 design. That said, his son and drawn proof indicate otherwise. Turnier joined the company in 1923, working in the mail room. He eventually worked his way up to the engineering department, helping make the dies that made the cookies, the industrial-sized cookie cutters as it were.\nSo where's the evidence? In the home of Bill Turnier, William's son, perched on a wall is a framed 1952, line drawn blueprint of the modern Oreo design. (If you're curious, Why Blueprints are Blue) Underneath the blueprint, it is written \"Drawn by W.A.Turnier 7-17-52,\" two years before the design would find itself on the Oreos sold in stores. Despite this evidence, the Kraft (who now owns Nabisco) Corporate Archives only says that Turnier was a \"design engineer\" and he received a Suggestion Award in 1972 for an idea \"that increased the production of Nilla Wafers on company machinery by 13 percent.\" So can Bill shed any light on what his father was thinking when he seems to have drawn the design? Not really, though he did admit that the design, while beautiful and resembling more mysterious symbols, probably had nothing to do with the Knights Templar. His father wasn't a Mason either.\nAs for the stuff between the intricately-designed cookies, the filling- it was made partially of lard \u2013 pig fat \u2013 until 1997. In 1994, Nabisco embarked on a nearly three year revamping process of the filling to take the lard out. In charge of this was Nabisco's principal scientist Sam Porcello, otherwise known as \"Mr. Oreo.\" By that point, Porcello was already a cookie legend, holding five Oreo related patents, including Oreos encased in white and dark chocolate. By December 1997, the Oreo cookie was lard-free, but there was another problem \u2013 the lard had been replaced by partially hydrogenated vegetable oil; yes, the very much not good for you trans fats. As the Chicago Tribune put it, \"Later, research showed that trans fat was even worse for the heart than lard.\" Finally, in January 2006, healthier (and more expensive) non-hydrogenated vegetable oil was put into Oreos instead. Today's filing is additionally made with loads of sugar and vanilla extract creating a cookie that still is delicious, but slightly better for you. Or, perhaps more aptly, less bad for you.\nBill also says that his father created or tweaked other well-know Nabisco designs in his half century with the company, including tweaks on the Nutter-Butter, the Ritz Cracker, and a dog's favorite treat, the Milkbone.\nThe basic Oreo cookie is 71 percent cookie, 29 percent cream filling.\nThis post has been republished with permission from TodayIFoundOut.com.

Gary Herbert&apos;s Medicaid plan faces a make-or-break vote in the state Senate this week, possibly as early as Tuesday.\nThe Republican governor&apos;s plan is an alternative to expanding the state-federal program as envisioned under President Barack Obama&apos;s health care law.\nAfter months of negotiating with federal officials, Herbert came away with an agreement to enroll thousands of poor Utah residents in private health plans and require them to help pay costs.\nIt mirrors similar proposals from other Republican governors pushing for a way to expand health coverage under the federal law while keeping it palatable to their right-leaning Legislatures.\nThis week, Utah&apos;s GOP-controlled Senate will have to square Herbert&apos;s plan with a competing proposal from Ogden Republican Sen. Allen Christensen.\nChristensen&apos;s bill, also scheduled for debate this week, would cost the state less and cover fewer people, but leave millions of federal dollars on the table. A similar plan is pending in Utah&apos;s House.\nIf the governor&apos;s office can usher Herbert&apos;s plan through the Legislature, it will return to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for final approval and then get the program up and running.\nTo allay lawmaker concerns about the state&apos;s ability to fund Herbert&apos;s plan, the governor&apos;s office announced last week that it was scaling back the three-year program to run for two years.\nLt. Gov. Spencer Cox, the governor&apos;s key broker with lawmakers on the issue, said the pared-back plan allows the state to pay for the program without raising taxes.\nCox said the two-year program will give the state time to study what&apos;s working, and by 2017, a new administration will be in the White House that could offer different options to the states.\nHerbert&apos;s plan includes plenty of other elements designed to appeal to Utah&apos;s GOP-dominated Legislature.\nParticipants pay some of their costs and can be enrolled in a job search and job training program.\nLast year, several Republican lawmakers said they wouldn&apos;t support the plan without the ability to revoke coverage for unemployed people who refuse to get a job.\nHerbert originally sought a work requirement for participants, but the Obama administration would not approve the idea. Instead, Utah can automatically enroll people in the job program as long as it lets them opt out penalty-free.\nTo make up for the watered-down deal, Herbert&apos;s office has said the state might consider cutting state-controlled benefits to those who refuse to participate in the job program, including taking away their driver&apos;s licenses.\n\"It was brought up as an option several months ago, and it hasn&apos;t gone anywhere from there,\" Cox said Monday.\nThe idea has been dormant since lawmaker concerns have shifted from whether Medicaid participants will be working to whether the state can pay for the program in the long term.\nCox said the state could revisit the driver&apos;s license idea once the Medicaid program launches.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Homelessness is up for the second year in a row. That is no surprise to me. I spent the last few days in New York City, where it seems the homeless are as numerous as the tourists. They are everywhere. Not that they are not numerous in our nation\u2019s capital, too. I returned to Washington by the train, and there are areas of Union Station that are as populated with homeless people as the nearby shelter. The scenes are appalling. What can be done?\nThe homeless have been one of the country\u2019s vexed problems since the 1980s, when the left became concerned about them \u2014 all the more so to give the Reagan administration another social problem to be blamed for. But the truth is that the homeless have always been the left\u2019s problem and the left\u2019s clients. Homelessness occurs mainly in big cities, those glistening jewels of Democratic government.\nSome 25 percent of the homeless in America today live in just two cities, New York and Los Angeles. Read up on homelessness and within a few paragraphs, you will find yourselves confronted by statistics on the lack of affordable rental homes, or the lack of affordable homes, or the underfunding of our welfare programs \u2014 all to be provided by government. To which I would respond that we have spent over a trillion dollars on welfare since the 1960s when then-President Lyndon Johnson launched his War on Poverty, and we now have about as many people living under the poverty level as when we began. All that has changed is the amount of money going to the impoverished. Yet the majority of articles I have read on poverty complained that we do not do enough to keep people from becoming homeless.\nNew York City increased services to the homeless to $172 million this year, much of it on improved security and living conditions in the city shelters. Yet homelessness in New York increased by 2.8 percent, and, if recent history is to be our guide, it is going to increase by more next year. Then perhaps the Democrats will increase their spending by another $172 million, possibly by $200 million. That is the way homelessness spending has been going since the days when we used the terms \u201chobos\u201d and \u201cskid rows\u201d to describe what was a minor urban problem. Now it is a major problem, and frankly, I do not think spending money on the homeless is the way to cope with the problem.\nHomelessness is caused by people living radically disorganized lives. The disorganization is caused by alcohol and drug addiction. It is caused by a multitude of pathologies that are never addressed by the social worker, or at least rarely addressed. Ask a social worker, if you can find one who has the time to answer your question. Most are very busy and overworked on problems that are, for the most part, impossible to solve.\nIn the meantime, many of the same people who paved the way for homelessness are busy legalizing marijuana \u2014 and, who knows, maybe cocaine and heroin next. In other words, they are paving the way to make sure that radically disorganized lives become still more disorganized. Moreover, those who are intent on legalizing drugs are paving the way for still more people to participate in the misery of the homeless.\nThe path to the future is not well-lit, but one thing is clear: If urban government continues as it has since the days when the homeless replaced the \u201chobo\u201d and \u201cskid row,\u201d the homeless population will only grow.\nR.

A central depository stores appraiser data, giving quality appraisers an advantage in the process if their profile within the system sets them apart as a quality appraiser.\nAn appraiser's profile is stored in the system, so it can be recalled multiple times.\nConsumers who will eventually come in face-to-face contact with an appraiser also will appreciate the system since it allows the end-customer to review an appraiser's photo and information via e-mail.\n\"The consumers will hopefully become more comfortable with appraisers,\" said Schroeder. \"We discovered the consumer would love the ability to validate and check out who is coming to their home.\"",

    "text": "Stock Market Blahs - Or Price Breakout?\nCAUTION is the pattern for Wall Street. There's occasional volatility in the Dow Jones industrial average, but within a lackluster trading range. That pattern of modest ups and downs, analysts suggest, is apt to continue through June and possibly into fall. Still, the consensus here is that the long range direction for the market - barring any unexpected shock - is for the Dow to move past the 3,000 mark. In recent days the Dow has been running around 2,890.\nAlmost anything is possible for the stock market, as longtime watchers know too well. For the moment, however, the market is characterized by the blahs. The ``players [investors] just aren't out there right now,'' says Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Bache Securities. Two weeks ago the Dow shot up some 70 points in a few days, notes Mr. Wachtel, but on very limited volume of share sales. Then on June 18, the market fell more than 53 points, but once again on limited volume. When trading volume is low, program trading can easily kick the market up and down in short bursts.\nJohn McElroy III, who is a principal with 1838 Investment Advisors, based in Philadelphia, also sees a pattern of caution and sluggishness, in part reflecting low volume and continued belt-tightening by the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed does not appear particularly eager to ease interest rates, despite the slowing of the economy.\n1838 Investment was the investment advisory arm for Drexel Burnham Lambert Group until the Philadelphia office went independent in a management buyout in 1988. 1838 Investment manages some $3.5 billion in assets. About 47 percent of that sum is now in stocks, another 47 percent in bonds, and the rest cash.\nThe percentage of assets placed in stocks has been reduced somewhat in recent months, reflecting Mr. McElroy's perception of a modestly overvalued stock market, as well as the relative attractiveness of bonds. If he felt that stocks were a little cheaper, McElroy would be prepared to buy back into equities. He's even willing to allocate as much as 70 percent of the portfolio to stocks.\nMcElroy figures one way to invest in stocks is to look for companies with a solid global presence.\nFor now, he sees a somewhat drifting market, and even, perhaps, a slight downward market correction during the next year - but with the long-term direction upward.\nCould that upturn come even sooner?\nSome analysts say yes. Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal &amp; Company, says the market may flounder for the next few weeks, yet push through 3,000 this summer. The market, he notes, hit an all-time high of 2,935.89 on June 15. June, Mr. Seagle claims, is historically slow for the market, although he's not quite sure why. But he expects the Dow to crack the 3,000 level and settle out at around 3,150 by the end of the year or early next year.\nStockholders can only hope he's right.",

    "text": "Worldwide Microdisplay market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 22.3% during the forecast period and reach value of US$ 5,782.6 Mn by 2027.\nAlbany, New York, Mar 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Albany, New York, March 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to a new research report on the global microdisplay market published by Transparency Market Research (TMR) the global microdisplay market is expected to reach value of US$ 5782.6 Mn by 2027, expanding at a CAGR of 22.3% from 2019 to 2027. According to the report, the global market is likely to continue to be influenced by a range of macroeconomic and market-specific factors in the next few years. In terms of demand, Asia Pacific is projected to continue to lead the global market, with the market in the region expanding at a CAGR of 24.8% between 2019 and 2027.\nThe global microdisplay market has witnessed strong growth over the last decade. One of the major drivers propelling the market is advantages associated with the use of microdisplays. Some of the significant features of microdisplay are high resolution and excellent image quality, low power consumption, and compact size. Generally, microdisplays are less than two inches in diagonal. In other words, their diagonal is approximately five centimeters. In addition, high-resolution microdisplays offer excellent viewing experience to users, which results in the increasing popularity of high-resolution display devices. These features allow the deployment of microdisplays in multiple applications ranging from consumer electronics to military, defense and aerospace. This, in turn, results in increasing popularity of microdisplays among manufacturers. This factor is likely to propel the global microdisplay market during the forecast period.\nThe global microdisplay market has been broadly segmented in terms of type, projection type, technology, end-use industry, and region. Based on type, the market has been segmented into reflective and transmissive. The transmissive segment was dominant, holding more than 50% share of the global market, in terms of revenue, in 2018. This can be attributed to the increasing penetration of LCoS and LCD technologies that the transmissive segment comprises. Furthermore, the segment is expected to expand at a significant CAGR of 21.3% during the forecast period. Growth of the transmissive segment is attributable to the large number of applications of transmissive microdisplays, which include near-to-eye displays (NEDs). In terms of projection type, the global microdisplay market has been divided into projection and near-to-eye displays. The near-to-eye displays (NEDs) segment is expected to expand at a high CAGR of 25.7% from 2019 to 2027, due to rising consumer inclination toward NED devices such as head-mounted displays and head-up displays. Based on technology, the market has been segmented into liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), digital light processing (DLP), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and others.\nThe OLEDs segment is anticipated to register the maximum CAGR of 25.3% during the forecast period. OLED displays are gradually replacing LCD displays in various devices including smart phones, smart watches, and television sets. This is primarily due to superior features of OLED displays compared to LCD displays such as wide viewing angles, large color gamut, and low power consumption. Based on end-use industry, the microdisplay market has been segregated into consumer electronics, health care, military, defense and aerospace, automotive, sports & entertainment, retail & hospitality, industrial, and others. The military, defense and aerospace segment is anticipated to dominate the global market during the forecast period. It held the maximum i.e. 29.80% of the market share in 2018.\nGeographically, the global microdisplay market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America. Among regions, North America is anticipated to hold the maximum share of the global market, while the market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to expand at the maximum CAGR during the forecast period. In 2018, North America accounted for 34.37% share of the global microdisplay market. This is attributable to early adoption of technologies and increasing adoption of microdisplays in the consumer electronics sector. Furthermore, the market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to expand at a high pace between 2019 and 2027, due to presence of leading players such as LG Display Co. Ltd., and Sony Corporation in the region.\nThe research study includes profiles of leading companies operating in the global microdisplay market. Market players have been profiled in terms of attributes such as company overview, financial overview, business strategies, and recent developments. Some of the prominent players operating in the global market are AU Optronics Corp, eMagin Corporation, Himax Technology Inc., KopIn Corporation Inc., LG Display Co. Ltd, Microvision Inc., Omnivision Technologies, Inc., Sony Corporation, Syndiant Inc., and Universal Display Corporation. Companies are focusing on expanding their business through strategic acquisitions and partnerships.",

    "text": "Clint Eastwood remains one of the giants of cinema because every performance just oozes integrity. Even as Eastwood aged, we, as an audience, got the sense that here was a man that refuses to compromise on the things that mattered. Rather like John Wayne you imagined that Eastwood spent his career playing a heightened version of himself.\nOver the space of 50 years we got the sense that Clint Eastwood, both on and off screen, was a man of few words but those that he did utter were very important.\nIn the political thriller, In The Line of Fire, directed by Das Boot film-maker Wolfgang Petersen, Clint Eastwood plays Frank Horrigan, a Secret Service agent who is haunted by his past. He is a member of an elite squad of agents charged with protecting the President of the United States. He was on duty the day that JFK visited Dallas and he still cannot forgive his shortcomings which allowed Kennedy to be assassinated.\nThe first thing that grabs your attention \u2013 and the most refreshing to be honest \u2013 is the fact that this is the first movie where Clint Eastwood plays his age. Although, this is a tense psychological thriller, Eastwood and Petersen allow themselves the time to poke fun at Eastwood\u2019s advancing years.\nHe\u2019s shown to be out-of-breath while running alongside the President\u2019s motorcade and for a while he is made to look as if his time has passed. He is seen as a bit of dinosaur by some of his younger associates and when a female Secret Service agent Lily Raines, played with sharp-timing by Rene Russo, joins the Presidential protection squad, a few misjudged sexist quips seem to have him on his way to his retirement party.\nBut, experience does count for something and Frank Horrigan is not the misogynist pig that he appears. The President is running for re-election, he\u2019s touring the country, glad-handing the party faithful, meeting the public and seducing the people with deep pockets so they will fund his campaign.\nWhile he is so visible, a mysterious figure wants to make a name for himself by killing the President and he wants to exploit Horrigan and his nightmares to do it. He plays mind-games with Horrigan during late night phone calls and gets the aging secret service agent jumpy, prompting him to sound false alarms, so further reducing his credibility in the eyes of his colleagues.\nHowever, the one person who stands by him and appreciates his instincts is Lily Raines. Unlike many films of this type, she is not interested in him romantically, but she enjoys being his partner protecting the President.\nIt seems that Mitch Leary, as the mysterious assassin calls himself, is a clever, master of disguise and enjoys playing a complicated game of cat and mouse with Horrigan and Lily.\nAfter Horrigan sounds a couple of false alarms, he\u2019s taken off the White House detail, and has to rely on Lily to keep him up to date on the President\u2019s movements and security arrangement while he tries to unmask the real Mitch Leary.\nWolfgang Petersen keeps the plot moving at a cracking pace, while still maintaining a wonderful degree of tension. As an audience you fed with tiny crumbs of evidence at the same time as Horrigan which means you are kept guessing right up until the last minute.\nHis real achievement as a film-maker is to create time for character-development during what is already atmospheric, incident-packed film. We see Frank and Lily slowly bond over this complex and twisted case.\nIt\u2019s not a traditional romance but it is a superior-kind of buddy movie. This is a movie primarily-focussed on solving a case and laying to rest ghosts of the past.\nThe performances of all three leads are superb and no-one relies on clich\u00e9 or caricature to keep the plot moving. These are three-dimensional characters and it is because you care about them is why the film is as effective as it is.\nEastwood and Russo unsurprisingly have the bulk of the screentime but Malkovich is never far from our thoughts. Mysterious Mitch is a huge, inescapable presence in the film. Malkovich relishes the opportunity to make him as creepy as possible and yet we still do understand what drives him. Wolfgang Petersen proved with Das Boot that he is a film-maker of real skill and this proves that he is equally talented in the thriller sphere.\nHe adds depth to the situation by allowing character to drive the plot and his flashbacks to the 1963 Kennedy years are brilliant. Dropping young Eastwood into the Dallas footage is a wonderfully convincing.\nThe film has a tough but satisfying conclusion but by the end we are ready for it. Like all good films In The Line of Fire works on many levels. It\u2019s a first class thriller but it\u2019s also a compelling examination of aging and the value of experience in the work place.",

    "text": "The remains of a former Macomb County commissioner and district court judge were found at an abandoned golf course in Florida, and the man's son is charged with murder.\nJames A. Scandirito Jr., 49, who Florida officials said had addresses in Delray Beach and Ft. Lauderdale, is being held on first-degree murder in the death of his father, James (Skip) Scandirito, 74, a former Macomb County commissioner and 41B District Court judge who served Mt. Clemens and Clinton and Harrison townships.\nIn January 2000, the elder Scandirito resigned as judge days before the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission planned to conduct a hearing on allegations that he offered five Macomb County women leniency in return for sexual favors, the Free Press reported.\nScandirito reported his father missing April 1, said Boca Raton Police Officer Jessica Desir. He said his father, of Boca Raton, was supposed to return home about 6 p.m. March 31, but never did.\nPolice began looking for the father and found inconsistencies in the timeline his son provided. His activities led police to the golf course at the former Ocean Breeze Golf Club, police said in a news release.\nIt stated that on April 4, human remains were found and later identified as the elder Scandirito by the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office. The son was identified as the suspect and arrested Monday while driving in Alachua County.\nArt Forgey, spokesman for the Alachua County Sheriff's Office, said the younger Scandirito was stopped driving northbound on I-75 in a Toyota Prius with a stolen tag and dark tinted windows in the late afternoon or early evening Monday.\nForgey said Scandirito probably will be extradited to Palm Beach County, about five hours south, sometime this week. Desir said Boca Raton Police haven't released how the elder Scandirito died.\nA woman who answered the phone Tuesday at the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office said there was no information available. The chief medical examiner could not be immediately reached Tuesday.\nNearly two decades ago, the elder Scandirito faced removal from his judicial office in Michigan; and three of the women settled lawsuits against him, according to a Free Press report.\nHe had been a judge since 1991. He was a county commissioner from 1986 to 1988 and was a member of the county Planning Commission.\nClinton Township Supervisor Bob Cannon said he knew the elder Scandirito as a \"popular, gregarious judge\" who he saw at golf outings, sporting events and political parties. He remembered him as \"a gentleman, very happy-go-lucky with a smile on his face.\"\n\"What a tragic ending,\" Cannon said.\nMt. Clemens Mayor Barb Dempsey said Scandirito was one of her son's soccer coaches.\n\"Skip lived a very colorful life,\" Dempsey said. She said she was shocked when he was accused nearly two decades ago and again by his death, which she echoed was \"tragic.\"\nThe elder Scandirito's wife, Therese, known as Terri, died last year. His brother, Dempsey said, was killed in a robbery many years ago in Detroit.",

    "text": "Of the unrecognized . . .\nSome days, when the early-evening light seemed to descend upon the Chicago skyline like folds of pastel drapery, Scott Fortino's eyes would rise from whatever manner of human misfortune he was confronting and he would know a secret joy.\nEverything around him argued against such joy: the tall, grim buildings, the blank landscape that pooled around those buildings like dried-up moats, the crumpled bags emblazoned with the names of fast-food emporiums, the scent of futility.\nBut to Fortino, 45, a Chicago police officer, the light changed everything. Even here in the Cabrini-Green public housing project, a place that many Chicagoans regard as \"dangerous, with nightmarish criminality,\" as Fortino puts it, he felt a steadying happiness.\nHe loved the light in the sky. He loved the way the buildings muscled their way into that sky. And he loved walking through the buildings, seeing the way the light from the windows shed a casual radiance on ordinary objects such as doors and walls.\n\"I can walk into a housing project and be transported by the quality of the light,\" Fortino said. \"That's what got me through seeing the other things -- the things you associate with public housing: the way the light falls on the buildings.\"\nWhen it came time for him to undertake a project for his graduate thesis in photography at the University of Illinois at Chicago, then, Fortino knew his destination: Cabrini, where he had walked a beat since 1988.\nStarting last summer, Fortino began to take pictures of the front doors of Cabrini apartments.\n\"Doors have a psychological weight to them,\" he said in the quiet, understated way he talks about his work. \"It just seemed to make sense to me.\"\nInitially, he photographed doors here and there, when he found himself intrigued by a particular color or a smattering of graffiti. That approach troubled him, however; he wanted the project to be more systematic, to record the range of Cabrini thresholds, not simply his own tastes and whims.\nSo he selected a single building -- 911 N. Hudson St. -- and took pictures of all 48 doors in the six-story structure. \"I chose it because it was manageable,\" Fortino said. \"Some of the buildings are 19 stories, with 20 apartments per floor. That was too much.\"\nHe and a friend, Tom Nowak, who helped with the lighting, were careful to treat the doors identically, \"to maintain a consistent viewpoint,\" Fortino said. He set up his camera and tripod the same distance from each entryway.\nHe asked residents for permission to take the pictures; none seemed to care one way or another. \"We initiated conversations with women going in and out of the apartments. Instead of being curious about us, mostly they wanted to know why things weren't getting fixed like they ought to be.\"\nFortino knows that his access to Cabrini -- an area riddled with crime and gang violence -- is enabled by his profession.\n\"When I'm there, it is known that I am the police. We use that knowledge as protection,\" he said. \"I have a radio with me. I am armed. Tom wears a bulletproof vest.\" Without those preparations, \"We would be prey, rather than on an equal footing.\"\nWhen Fortino recently displayed the photographs for a committee of UIC professors, a requirement for graduate students in the School of Art & Design, the reaction was intense. Many appreciated Fortino's careful archiving of objects not often viewed by anyone but the very poor; others felt Fortino had somehow insulted Cabrini residents, invading their privacy by presenting their front doors in such a stark, blunt manner.\nOne thing was clear, however: Fortino's work left no one unmoved. And if provoking a reaction is one of the purposes of art, if the point is to shake people out of their numbed neutrality, then the photographs are undeniably, if disturbingly, successful.\nAlso, rather unexpectedly, the photographs are suffused with beauty.\n\"Beauty\" is not a word Fortino or many other serious photographers would employ. It is an unfashionable word because, as Fortino explained, \"It's hierarchical. If something is beautiful, that means something else is ugly, and that's a value judgment.\"\nAn amateur onlooker, however, can say it out loud without fear of rebuke: The doors, in their color and variety, are beautiful in a scruffy, utilitarian way. They are as complicated as faces; like faces, they both hide and reveal, keep in and keep out. To some, a closed door may be an unfinished sentence or a held breath. In the next moment, anything can happen.\nThe collection of Cabrini doors, moreover, subtly recalls the well-known poster series celebrating doors in places such as Dublin, doors with fancy carving and stained glass. A door is a door is a door -- except that it isn't.\nNowak, who teaches photography part time at Columbia College, said he initially wondered about the point of Fortino's project. \"I thought, `Doors?' and I said, `Scott, can't you find something else?' But as we walked through the building, I saw that the doors had character. They weren't all the same, by any means. Each door was different.\"\nEsther Parada, a UIC photography professor for whose class Fortino undertook his \"doorway project,\" as he calls it, said the discomfort aroused by the photographs may originate in concerns among documentary photographers about the objectification of poverty and other conditions.\n\"Since the late 1970s, there has been a lot more attention to the power dynamics in photography: Who's looking at whom and through what lens? It's all about the manipulation of framing and point of view.\"\nIn earlier times, people looked at photographs as simple truth. As Susan Sontag phrased it in \"On Photography,\" her 1977 book, \"Photographs furnish evidence. A photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happened.\" Words could be slanted, but pictures didn't lie: \"What is written about a person or event is frankly an interpretation, as are handmade visual statements, like paintings and drawings. Photographed images do not seem to be statements of the world as much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality.\"\nNow, however, virtually everyone concedes that photographs are no more truthful than anything else, that they represent a prejudiced point of view just as do words. The concern, therefore, is that by choosing certain objects or people of which to make pictures, the photographer exerts power over the subjects.\nIn other words, while we have Fortino's view of the Cabrini doors, we do not -- because of a variety of factors -- have the Cabrini residents' view of Fortino's door or their own doors. Whether we think of it consciously or not, photographs are transactions, representing power relationships. Race adds another complication: Fortino is white, Cabrini predominantly black; he is an outsider looking at a world not his own.\nCabrini spokeswoman Carol Steele, while unfamiliar with Fortino's project, said she is glad someone saw beyond what she regards as the buildings' ill-kept exteriors -- but she wishes he had gone past the individual front doors as well.\n\"The media is always taking pictures of the outsides of the buildings,\" said Steele, president of the Cabrini Rowhouse Management Council. \"They don't go inside. People don't realize that (Cabrini residents) take care of their places too. They live just like everybody else.\"\nFortino, for his part, is unfazed by questions and reservations. In many ways, the project represents the point at which his two worlds -- law enforcement and graduate school -- intersect, and so he anticipated a few ragged edges and mismatched surfaces.\n\"For a long time, I felt the two worlds would never meet,\" he recalled. \"Among my friends in the police department, I was considered very liberal, because I was going to art school. Among my friends in the art world, I was very conservative, because I was the police.\n\"Now, one seems to inform the other. My police life has become a large part of my art life.\"\nBorn and raised on Chicago's Southwest Side, Fortino remembers hearing his father and uncle talk about the public housing structures that were pounded in like spikes against the city's skyline. \"They were talked about in hushed tones, as dangerous places. You hear those things when you're a kid and there's a sense of wonder, of curiosity.\"\nJust before graduation from Columbia College, Fortino joined the police department. He enrolled in graduate photography courses at UIC, but police work gradually absorbed him and he dropped out in 1981.\n\"I was wrapped up in the lifestyle of being the police,\" he said. \"The thesis just couldn't get done.\"\nReturning to UIC last year, he found that the two worlds seemed less antithetical. \"Things happen for a reason,\" said Fortino, who will remain with the police force but hopes to display his photographs in a gallery. \"This is right for me now.\"\nFortino is no longer assigned to Cabrini. When he goes there to take photographs, though, the residents remember him. And he remembers them, as he admires the complicated light surrounding their homes.\n\"The light -- especially at this time of year -- is very, very nice. I could look at it all day.\"\nAs Fortino knows, he may not be looking much longer at the light falling on Cabrini. As part of its $1 billion project to demolish some 19,000 public housing units and resettle the city's poor in the next decade, the Chicago Housing Authority has torn down two of Cabrini's 24 buildings; six more are scheduled to fall. While the building in which Fortino has been working is not on the list at present, according to a CHA spokesperson the demolition project will alter the Cabrini landscape irrevocably.\n\"I wanted to make a record, a way to preserve this,\" Fortino said. \"It comes down to an appreciation for what's around you.\"\nAdditional material published Jan. 12, 1999:Corrections and clarifications.A Cabrini-Green building depicted in a photograph in Thursday's Tempo section was incorrectly identified as the six-story structure featured in a Chicago police officer's photography project.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the Kaczynski family, the loved ones of those killed in this tragic plane crash, and the Polish nation.\nToday\u2019s loss is devastating to Poland, to the United States, and to the world. President Kaczynski was a distinguished statesman who played a key role in the Solidarity movement, and he was widely admired in the United States as a leader dedicated to advancing freedom and human dignity. With him were many of Poland\u2019s most distinguished civilian and military leaders who have helped to shape Poland\u2019s inspiring democratic transformation. We join all the people of Poland in mourning their passing.\nToday, there are heavy hearts across America. The United States cherishes its deep and abiding bonds with the people of Poland. Those bonds are represented in the strength of our alliance, the friendships among our people, and the extraordinary contributions of Polish-Americans who have helped to shape our nation.\nIt is a testament to the strength of the Polish people that those who were lost were travelling to commemorate a devastating massacre of World War II as the leaders of a strong, vibrant, and free Poland. That strength will ensure that Poland emerges from the depths of this unthinkable tragedy, and that the legacy of the leaders who died today will be a light that continues to guide Poland \u2013 and the world \u2013 in the direction of human progress.\n\"I think the whole world will be saddened and in sorrow as a result of the tragic death in a plane crash of President Kaczynski and his wife Maria and the party that were with them,\" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. \"We know the difficulties that Poland has gone through, the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement. We know the contribution he made to the independence and the freedom of Poland.\"\n\"On this difficult day the people of Russia stand with the Polish people,\" Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel recalled her meetings with Kaczynski and said that \"we always found a result in the end.\"\n\"I knew that his whole life had been dedicated to the fight for the freedom of Poland and the freedom of Europe,\" she said.\n\"We will miss Lech Kaczynski in Germany too,\" she said. \"Germany is mourning today with the whole Polish people.\"\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy in a statement paid tribute to Kaczynski. \"Lech Kaczynski devoted his life to his country. A tireless defender of the ideas in which he believed, he always battled with conviction for the values that founded his entry into politics: democracy, liberty and the fight against totalitarianism,\" Sarkozy said.\nItalian Premier Silvio Berlusconi said \"It is a grave loss that has stricken a friendly country and in which I am sharing in with my heart.\"\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Kaczynski had \"served his country and people with distinction and conviction, and was deservedly respected internationally. That he died en route to an event marking a new level of reconciliation between Poland and Russia is particularly poignant.\"\nPope Benedict XVI said in a condolence message that he learned of the deaths with \"deep pain\" and that he wanted to assure the Polish people of his \"spiritual closeness\" in this moment.\nEuropean Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said, \"I have worked very closely with President Kaczynski, in a spirit of loyalty, and I respected in him a very determined Polish patriot who at the same time was very committed to our European Union and to the values of freedom and solidarity.\n\"The European Commission joins me in this moment in the expression of sympathy and tribute.\"\nCatherine Ashton, the EU&apos;s security and foreign affairs chief, spoke by telephone Saturday with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski to express her condolences.\nShe told him, \"I would like to send my heartfelt condolences to the people of Poland and express our solidarity with you at this very difficult and sad time. In particular, I want to express my sympathies to the family and friends of those who died.\"\nNATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen: \"On behalf of all of NATO, and myself personally, I express my most profound condolences to the people of Poland, and to the families of President and Mrs Kaczynski and all those who have died in this terrible accident. This is a tragedy for them and for Poland. My thoughts are with them today.\"\n\"Ukraine has learned about the plane crash ... with great sorrow and inexpressible pain,\" Ukraine&apos;s President Viktor Yanukovych said in a statement. \"We share the deep pain of a loss that hit the friendly Polish people and mourn together with the families of the dead.\"\nFormer President George W. Bush said in a statement that he&apos;s deeply saddened by the news of Kaczynski&apos;s death. He and former First Lady Laura Bush have fond memories of visits with Kaczynski and his wife, Bush said, and want to express their condolences to the families of all the people killed in the crash.\n\"President Kaczynski, as a dedicated and honorable leader who assiduously defended the rights of his country, will without a doubt live in the hearts of all Polish people while all those who had come to know him will remember him with the utmost respect,\" Cyprus President Dimitris Christofias said in a letter to Poland&apos;s acting President Bronislaw Komorowski.",

    "text": "An inmate makes a phone call from his cell at the Orange County jail in Santa Ana, California, May 24, 2011.\nThe New York City Council voted this week to provide free telephone calls for anyone held in the city\u2019s correctional facilities. The move will save New York City inmates and their families an estimated US$8 million a year.\nUntil this law takes effect, phone services in the city\u2019s jails will continue to be provided by Securus Technologies which, like other private companies, charges inmates and their families, the ultimate \u2018captive customers\u2019, at higher than average rates.\nCurrently, Securus charges an initial fee of 50 cents, plus 5 cents per minute for calls within New York, as well as fees for depositing funds. The cost of calls can quickly become prohibitive. With black people and Latinos making up over 86% of inmates in New York City, communities of color primarily bear these high costs. Many already lived in poverty before their arrests, and are held in pre-trial detention simply because they cannot afford to pay bail.\nThe new law will also prohibit the city from making revenue for itself on phone call fees. City government had a revenue sharing agreement with Securus, which guaranteed the city at least $5 million in income each year.\nPhone calls provide an important link between people in custody and their families. Inmates that maintain family ties have an easier re-entry process, and may be less likely to reoffend. Children also benefit from having regular contact with parents in prison. The city should not look to raise revenues by charging people for these vital connections, nor should low income families be forced to sacrifice basic necessities to pay for calls.\nLast year, a court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission cannot set caps on the cost of in-state prison phone calls, leaving it to each state and local jurisdiction to set the fees. New York City is among the first jurisdictions to eliminate fees altogether, and prohibit revenue sharing contracts. In the absence of national legislation, other cities and states should follow suit. People in custody should be able to stay in touch with their families without paying an exorbitant price.",

Monell will wait until Monday to see whether a judge will let him out of Cumberland County Jail while his highly publicized case moves through the pre-trial process.\nMonell, whose 15-day flight from arrest ended Jan. 2, was given an initial hearing at 2 p.m. Wednesday before Cumberland County Superior Court Judge Cristen D\u2019Arrigo. The court reviewed the charges state police filed on Dec. 19, 2016 and what legal representation Monell intends to have.\nThe defendant unexpectedly did not come to court but appeared via video from the county jail along with defense attorney Lindsey Seidel for the hearing.\nMonell will get a pre-trial detention hearing before D\u2019Arrigo at 9 a.m. Monday. The judge at the time will hear from county Assistant Prosecutors Michael Ostrowski and Brent Hopkins why he should not be allowed to leave jail. Monell, 32, of Cedarville, is charged with first-degree murder and other offenses in the stabbing death of his estranged wife Tara O'Shea-Watson in their home in the Laurel Lake section of Commercial Township.\nMonell said he would reside with his father in Pittsgrove if released. Bail was set at $1 million for him in December.\nA new state law that took effect this month allows the matter of detention before trial to be taken up at a separate hearing, and county prosecutors intend to handle it that way.\nUnder new bail reform rules effective for anyone arrested as of Jan. 1, the accused won\u2019t have to pay bail to get out.\nThose facing lower level charges will be released pending trial. Those accused of more serious crimes will go through a risk assessment and appear before a judge.\nIf they're deemed too dangerous or unlikely to show up for court, they'll be kept in jail until trial.\nMost courtroom seats were filled for the hearing, among them relatives of the murder victim. County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae and First Assistant Prosecutor Harold Shapiro observed the hearing sitting with relatives.\nBryan Dunn, a cousin of the victim, was among relatives in court for the hearing. He spoke afterward for the family with reporters.\n\"We are happy that he is in custody,\" said Dunn, a Clayton resident. \"We're just waiting for justice.\"\nDunn said relatives and friends are in constant contact since the murder.\n\"And we are a tight-knit family,\" he said. \"Anybody can tell you that.\"\nDunn said his cousin was divorcing Monell.\nEven knowing what O'Shea-Watson was going through with Monell, Dunn said her murder was a shock.\n\"She was supposed to be in Tennessee but the justice system has failed her in that departure,\" he said. \"She wasn't leaving without the children.\"\nWebb-McRae could not comment on Monell's health. He was taken to Inspira Medical Center Vineland after his capture Monday afternoon in Folsom Borough.\nThe prosecutor declined comment on the circumstances of his arrest.\nNew Jersey State Police called to her house on the morning of Dec. 19 reported finding O\u2019Shea-Watson unresponsive and unconscious.\nState troopers captured Monell Monday in response to a tip, ending a 15-day manhunt. Monell was found hiding in woods.",

For the little guy?\nSmall farmers hoping to carve out a living in a tough industry are increasingly relying on agritourists to pluck apples from their orchards and wander through their corn mazes \u2014 and then post the sort of just-so photographs that will draw more tourists to the country.\nPhu Mai, a marketing specialist with the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, says 287 of the state\u2019s 7,755 farms are offering up some kind of agritourism now \u2014 hay rides, petting zoos, or cider donuts. And the payoff is pretty good: about $12 million in annual revenue. Growth is strong, too. Between 2007 and 2012, the most recent data available, Massachusetts farmers saw a 125 percent increase in agritourism.\nSauchuk Farm in Plympton has taken a healthy slice of that growth. \u201cPeople love to take pictures and post to social media,\u201d says Scott Sauchuk, who started the farm about 18 years ago. His website is filled with photos of toddlers sidling up to pumpkins and parents playing a game called \u201cBarnyard Basketball\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s rows of amusement-park-style hoops made for rapid-fire shooting.\nAnd that\u2019s just a small sampling of the kid-friendly, Instagrammable entertainment at the farm. There\u2019s also a 100-foot-long zip line, a car in the shape of a cow, a little roller coaster, a sandbox, a slide, jumping pillows, and fruit-firing guns known as apple blasters.\nJimmy Hunt, a sixth-generation farmer at Hunt Farm, a dairy outfit in Orange, rented a GPS and spent about 25 hours cutting a corn maze to attract visitors. An aerial view, posted on his Facebook page, reveals the words \u201cHunt Farm, Dairy Divine, Since 1879,\u201d built into the sprawling pattern. Hunt has also hosted an Open Farm Day for two years running, where visitors can meet the cows and sample some of their work: cheese and ice cream. In Holden, Lilac Hedge Farm held a music and beer festival last summer and sold tickets online.\nAny successful marketing campaign needs a good logo, of course. At Lilac Hedge, it\u2019s three little lilacs set against an orange frame. At Cider Hill Farm, it\u2019s a golden \u201cC\u201d and \u201cH,\u201d curved into the shape of an apple.\nJenny Durocher, retail marketing manager for Cider Hill, says the logo is everywhere: on labels for jams, jellies, and apparel \u2014 and sitting atop its slickly produced website, where a gauzy, high-production-value video runs on a loop.\nKids run through a maze in slow motion, weathered hands hold a pile of fresh blueberries, and brown, sugary cider donuts beckon. \u201cFarm, Family, and Fun,\u201d reads the text splashed over the video.

    "text": "WORCESTER \u2013 Growing up in Dana Point, California, during the 1980s, Tanya L. Brown and her three sisters spent a lot of time playing on the beach and in the ocean.\nThey were popular girls, and their home was the place that friends congregated before heading home in time for their curfew - just before the street lights came on.\nBy the time Ms. Brown graduated high school and was heading to college, six of her friends had died, mostly related to drinking and driving.\n\u201cThere was no (drug) addiction like we see today. Back then, drinking and driving was a big problem,\u201d Ms. Brown said in a telephone interview last week. She is the baby sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, O.J. Simpson\u2019s ex-wife, who was murdered in 1994.\nMs. Brown, an author and life coach, will be the keynote speaker at the SHINE Initiative\u2019s 12th annual Keep Your Mind Open gala at Mechanics Hall on Thursday.\nHer sister, who was 10 years older, was murdered along with a friend, Ronald Goldman. She said the murder, which remains unsolved, turned the family\u2019s lives upside down. But she continued to hold in the grief, though her parents were both very supportive. They taught their children to move on with life. Grief counselors for young people, she said, wasn\u2019t something that was popular then.\nFinally, in 2004, when her fianc\u00e9 canceled their wedding four days before the event, her emotional and mental health was on overload, leading to a mental breakdown.\n\u201cIt was another loss, and I went into full self-destruct mode. I was popping pills, drinking and eating everything, and I ballooned up to 200 pounds,\u201d she recalled.\nDuring one of her emotional episodes at the family home, she blamed her parents for everything that had happened to her, as well as for Nicole\u2019s murder. She left the room and prepared to end her life by downing 24 Klonopin pills with a glass of wine.\nOne of her sisters intervened, and her family had her admitted to a psychiatric unit at a local hospital for two weeks. There, she was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, also referred to as clinical depression. She spent another few weeks in outpatient therapy. Ms. Brown said that led her to get a graduate degree in psychology and become an advocate for education about domestic violence and mental wellness. She is the author of \"Finding Peace Amid the Chaos: My Escape From Depression and Suicide.\"\nThe first week of October each year is Mental Health Awareness Week. Also called Mental Illness Awareness Week, it was established by Congress in 1990.\nApproximately 60 million Americans will likely experience a mental disorder in their lifetime, but more than half of people living with diagnosable mental health disorders do not seek treatment, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\nThe SHINE Initiative was founded by Fidelity Bank in 2004 with input from its employees to reduce the stigma of mental health conditions, end discrimination and raise awareness and understanding about mental health conditions in children, adolescents and young adults.\nThe annual gala celebrates the accomplishments of the nonprofit while raising funds to support the expansion of programs, including Student Wellness Advisory Teams that empower middle and high school students to become mental wellness advocates in their schools. The student-led teams began in 2015, and now number about 17; that is expected to increase to 40 within the next year.\nMs. Brown is among several high-profile mental health advocates who have spoken at the annual SHINE galas. Last year\u2019s keynote speaker was Margaret Trudeau, the mother of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who discussed her experiences with bipolar disorder, including how the stigma of mental illness helped to delay her diagnosis and treatment.\nThis year\u2019s event also celebrates the work of Paul Richard of Worcester, the outgoing executive director of the SHINE Initiative. Also, Fred Kaelin of West Boylston will be introduced as the new executive director; he began work in September and will begin his leadership Nov. 1.\nMr. Richard, 66, was director of development for Community Healthlink for more than a decade before he became executive director of the SHINE Initiative. He said the nonprofit has impacted tens of thousands of young people and adults.\n\u201cWhat makes me the most proud is the direct engagement with young people throughout Central Massachusetts \u2026 their willingness and desire to talk about mental health and mental wellness in a positive uplifting way,\u201d he said. After retirement, he said, he plans to stay involved in some form of human services.\nMr. Kaelin, 44, married father of two young boys, said his main goal is to continue the work that Mr. Richard has done to build the agency and to get into more schools throughout Central Massachusetts and Middlesex County.\nBefore being tapped for his new position, Mr. Kaelin had served as executive director of Dynamy, a residential internship program, and more recently as chief development officer of Youth Opportunities Upheld, commonly known as YOU Inc.\nThe Initiative hopes to steer people to more resources through a $57,000 Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts technology initiative to build an interactive website. The new website should be up and running in a few months, Mr. Kaelin said.\n\u201cThe more awareness that gets out there about mental health and the more people who get support earlier in life means a community will be healthier, not just the individual who gets the individual support,\u201d he said.\nTickets to the gala, which begins at 5 p.m. Thursday at Mechanics Hall, cost $100. For tickets or information, call (978) 870-1494, or email Mr. Richard at PRichard@SHINEinitiative.org.",

    "text": "The first vote by a Senate committee is due over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court.\nIt follows Thursday's testimony by Mr Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault.\nDr Ford, close to tears, described the alleged 1982 attack in detail, saying it had \"drastically\" affected her life. Judge Kavanaugh angrily denied he had assaulted her or anyone.\nPresident Donald Trump has urged the full Senate to approve his nominee.\nThat vote is expected next week. Republicans currently have a majority of 51-49 in the Senate, but a number of senators on both sides are said to be undecided.\nJudge Kavanaugh's appointment would tilt the balance in favour of conservatives for years to come.\nFor this reason, Republicans accuse the Democrats of seeking to delay the confirmation until after the mid-term elections in November when they hope to win enough seats to stop it altogether. Democrats counter by accusing Republicans of trying to \"railroad\" the process.\nThe Supreme Court plays a vital role in US political life - appointed for life, its nine members have the final say on US law.\nThis includes highly contentious social issues, such as abortion, and challenges to government policy.\nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who was believed to be wavering, issued a statement shortly before the committee began sitting on Friday morning stating that he would back Judge Kavanaugh.\nOn his way to the committee room following the release of the statement, he was berated by two women who said they were victims of sexual violence and urged him to change his mind.\nAs the committee began, the bitter political divide was clear as an attempt by Democrats to call a further witness - Mark Judge, who Dr Ford said was present during the alleged sexual assault - was defeated by the 11 Republicans voting against the 10 Democrats.\nA subsequent motion to move to a vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination was passed despite vocal Democratic objections. Some Democratic senators refused to vote on that and walked out of the hearing.\nIn a letter after Thursday's hearing, Robert Carlson, head of the American Bar Association - the body representing US lawyers and students of law - urged a delay of the vote to enable the FBI to check the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.\nThe association had previously supported Judge Kavanaugh for the role.\nWhat did Christine Blasey Ford say?\nThursday's hearing, which lasted for nine hours, brought an outpouring of support for Dr Ford - a university professor - from the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault.\nPrior to Thursday, no-one had heard from the 51-year-old publicly since the allegations arose.\n\"I am here today not because I want to be,\" Dr Ford said. \"I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\"\nShe alleged he and his friend Mark Judge had locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in a Washington DC suburb in the summer of 1982, when she was 15 and Judge Kavanaugh was 17.\nDr Ford said Brett Kavanaugh had tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her. Both men were \"drunkenly laughing\", she said.\nShe added: \"Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details.\"\nUnder questioning by a Democratic senator, she said her most vivid memory was \"the laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense... They were laughing with each other - two friends having a really good time with one another\".\nIn an answer to a question from another Democrat about claims of mistaken identity, Dr Ford said she was \"100%\" certain that Judge Kavanaugh had assaulted her.\nHow did Brett Kavanaugh respond?\nThe 53-year-old federal judge took a combative approach but occasionally became emotional.\n\"This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,\" he told the committee.\n\"The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.\n\"Since my nomination in July there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation.\"\nHe insisted he would not be \"intimidated\" into withdrawing from the process.\n\"You may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit. Never.\"\nJudge Kavanaugh said he did not doubt that Prof Ford had been assaulted, but insisted: \"I've never sexually assaulted Dr Ford - or anyone.\"\nHe admitted he had drunk beer while at high school, but said he had never got so drunk as to forget events.\nHe added that his calendars for 1982 - which he had kept - showed he had not attended a party at the location Prof Ford had described.\nThe Democratic senators on the committee have called on President Trump to \"immediately withdraw\" Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.\nMoments after the hearing ended, however, President Trump tweeted that he was standing by his nominee and said he found Judge Kavanaugh's testimony \"powerful, honest and riveting\".\nMr Trump has repeatedly defended the judge's character, saying he is \"one of the highest quality people\" he has ever met.\nThousands of protesters against the nomination took to the streets on Thursday and 59 people were arrested near the Supreme Court in Washington, DC.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation could result in a recommendation that the candidate should be confirmed or rejected, or in no recommendation at all.\nAfter Friday's panel vote, the full Senate could start taking procedural votes at the weekend.\nA final vote by the full chamber could come as soon as Tuesday.\nA simple majority of those present is needed for the confirmation. If there is a tie, the vice-president, who presides over the Senate, casts the deciding vote.\nJudge Kavanaugh denies these allegations, and on Thursday called Ms Swetnick's allegation \"a joke\" and \"a farce\".\nThe US Supreme Court: Who are the justices?",

    "text": "In the past few weeks, senators have been so focused on squabbling over the nomination of Chuck Hagel as secretary of Defense that it seemed like John Brennan would have a relatively easy time being confirmed as director of the CIA. However, following NBC News\u2019s release yesterday of a Justice Department white paper that outlines the administration\u2019s legal justification for conducting drone strikes against Americans suspected of terrorism, Brennan\u2019s nomination is quickly morphing into a showdown over the Obama administration\u2019s drone policy. Now the New York Times has added more fuel to the controversy, revealing that the United States has a secret CIA drone base in Saudi Arabia that\u2019s used to conduct strikes in neighboring Yemen.\nThe Saudi base, which was constructed two years ago, was first used to launch the drones that killed American-born Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki. Though much of the debate has focused on the targeting of U.S. citizens, only four Americans have been killed in U.S. airstrikes in Yemen since 2002. By comparison, at least 24 people have already been killed by U.S. drones in Yemen this year, and since the campaign started more than 3,000 militants and civilians have been killed in strikes in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.\nAs the the White House\u2019s chief counterterrorism adviser, Brennan is the main coordinator of the terrorist \u201ckill list\u201d and oversees the drone strikes conducted by both the military and the CIA. Brennan was previously the CIA\u2019s station chief in Saudi Arabia, and urged the Obama administration to take the threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network\u2019s Yemen affiliate, more seriously.\nInterestingly, some journalists have known about the \u201csecret\u201d Saudi base for some time. The Washington Post says it didn\u2019t disclose the location at the administration\u2019s request, but it \u201clearned Tuesday night that another news organization was planning to reveal the location of the base, effectively ending an informal arrangement among several news organizations that had been aware of the location for more than a year.\u201d The Post reports that it\u2019s just one of a \u201cgrowing constellation of drone bases\u201d operated by the U.S. overseas.\nFor years, critics of the drone campaign have been calling on Obama to make good on his pledge to have the \u201cmost transparent administration in history,\u201d and with Brennan\u2019s nomination, now they feel they finally have a bit of leverage. As Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Intelligence Committee, told the Post, \u201cIf the Congress doesn\u2019t get answers to these questions now, it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get them in the future.\u201d It sounds like Brennan\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday is going to get ugly.",

In fact, it\u2019s part of a recent trend in which gender issues have been elevated by world leaders in international fora and integrated into mainstream policy discussions.\nConsider, for example, Canada\u2019s leadership of the Group of Eight (G8) in June 2010, which gave rise to the Muskoka Initiative on maternal and child health and led to a commitment to invest in national health systems.\nThe foreign ministers of the G8 have also highlighted the role of women in peace and security. In 2012, the ministers called for implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security. A year later, the same group endorsed a declaration on preventing sexual violence in conflict.\nGender equality has been a focus of the Group of Twenty (G20) Summit as well. In November 2014, each G20 country set a historic commitment to reduce the gap between the share of men and women in their workforce by 25 percent by 2025.\nThe G20 commitment to increase women\u2019s labor force participation was echoed at the Kruen summit this week in the G7 declaration that emerged. It was also augmented by a new agreement to increase women\u2019s vocational training in the developing world by one-third by 2030. German Chancellor Angela Merkel highlighted the relationship between gender equality and economic progress in her closing remarks, noting that barriers to women persist everywhere in the world\u2014\u201cnot only in the developing countries where a lot of work still needs to be done,\u201d but also \u201cin industrialized countries.\u201d She promised to convene a conference in September to address the \u201cstructural differences between men and women\u201d that remain.\nResearch from major international economic institutions supports this focus on gender equality by world leaders. Over the past two decades, analyses from the International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and World Bank have demonstrated the growth potential of increasing women\u2019s labor force participation. The Bank is in the process of revamping its gender strategy, and mainstreaming the discussion of women\u2019s economic empowerment is a core piece of its new concept note.\nRecent international commitments to advance gender equality are undoubtedly a critical step forward\u2014but the real test of progress for women will lie in their implementation. To ensure gains for women and girls\u2014and for the health of entire communities and economies\u2014such declarations must be coupled with a push to implement the policies they prescribe.",

The aim was on stockpiling young talent and the Senators had two picks in the first round.\nThe Senators selected center Mika Zibanejad of Djurgardens IF in Sweden with the sixth pick, then drafted right wing Stefan Noesen of Plymouth of the Ontario Hockey League at No. 21.\nBut the Senators scouts really liked the potential of a 6-foot-2, 204-pound left wing who'd just completed a second solid season with Peterborough of the Ontario Hockey League, so they made a trade with the Detroit Red Wings to secure the No. 24 selection.\nWith it, they landed Puempel, the kid they were after.\nAt the age of 17, the Windsor, Ontario, native led Peterborough in scoring with 33 goals and 64 points. That performance earned him the Emms Family Award as the 2009 OHL Freshman of the Year and a spot on the all-rookie team.\nHis second year in Peterborough was even more convincing. Though cut short by a hip injury that required surgery and limited him to 55 games, Puempel paced the team in scoring with 34 goals and 69 points.\nAfter being drafted, Puempel returned to Peterborough, but by mid-season, he requested, and received, a trade in order to play for a contending team his final year of junior. He was traded to Kitchener of the OHL and scored 35 goals and 47 points in 51 games. Kitchener reached the playoffs, but was eliminated in the second round.\nBeginning his pro career with Binghamton of the American Hockey League in 2013-14, Puempel tied Mike Hoffman for team honors with 30 goals. He split 2014-15 between Binghamton and Ottawa, making his NHL debut on Feb. 21, 2015, in a 4-1 victory against the Florida Panthers, but again started the next season with Binghamton.\nPuempel scored 17 goals and 30 points in 34 games to earn another call-up. In his 26 games with the Senators in 2015-16, he showed signs of being ready to make the big step to full-time NHL duty.\nClaimed on waivers by NY Rangers from Ottawa, November 21, 2016.\nTraded to Detroit by NY Rangers for Ryan Sproul, October 21, 2017.",

It's an indispensable role within a growing and pivotal field of research that is laying the groundwork to modernize the Army's greatest asset -- the individual Soldier.\nYet, as newly trained Soldiers, the fundamental combat skills they learned in basic and advanced individual training can rapidly diminish if not performed regularly. To maintain their combat readiness while serving the Army S&T community, NSRDEC's non-commissioned officers responsible for their daily supervision began incorporating a field training regimen into the HRV schedule with the first group of young Soldiers to arrive in FY2018.\n\"It's important for HRV Soldiers to be proficient in the basic Soldier skills they'll be using when they leave Natick and get to their first units\" said Staff Sergeant Anthony Sandoval, the Operations NCO for NSRDEC's Headquarters Research and Development Detachment. \"Part of our job as NCOs is to make sure they're ready.\"\nTo accomplish this, Sandoval's team of NCOs developed and implemented a condensed field and weapons training program around the HRVs busy schedules supporting NSRDEC research studies designed to brush up on their land navigation and marksmanship skills.\n\"These are critical skills for all Soldiers to have, but especially this group of HRVs because they are all 11 Bravo's [Military Occupational Specialty 11-B - Infantry] including two female Infantry Soldiers,\" said Sandoval. \"Every Soldier needs to practice repeatedly for these maneuvers become second nature.\"\nNSRDEC's NCOs made sure the field training didn't conflict with the HRV's obligations as research subjects.\n\"We started with classroom sessions for basic and advanced land navigation before bringing them out to the [Land Navigation] course at Fort Devens,\" said Sergeant Andrew Cochran, HRDD platoon sergeant. \"We are retraining them on the M-4 rifle/carbine and crew-served weapons to maintain their marksmanship skills.\"\n\"We also arranged for them to get some time on the EST [Engagement Skills Trainer] when it's not being used for research purposes,\" said Cochran.\nAs they help Army scientists' research and develop future Soldier performance capabilities, HRV Soldiers are honing their own lethality. And it's the NSRDEC's NCOs who make it happen.",

The ramps will provide access to the Merchandise Group headquarters of Sears, Roebuck and Co. when it opens next year in Hoffman Estates.\nSears is paying the bulk of the cost for the Beverly Road project and a portion of the Highway 59 cost.\nRamps are also proposed for Meacham Road, which currently has no approach to the tollway.\nMullins said a toll plaza west of Roselle would more fairly place the burden of tolls on new traffic heading to Hoffman Estates.\nBut Hoffman Estates officials did not endorse Palatine`s solution and said they were not convinced that new traffic would necessarily spill into local streets.\n''If Palatine is concerned about this, they need to be able to show and demonstrate through a traffic study that cars are going to do what they say they are going to do,'' Hoffman Estates Village Manager Peter Burchard said. Palatine has not ordered a traffic study.\nNoting that toll booths are proposed for on and off ramps at Illinois Highway 59, Mayor Michael O`Malley said that ''should alleviate part of Palatine`s fear.'' But he declined further comment on Palatine`s proposal until representatives of the tollway authority have appeared before the Hoffman Estates Village Board.",

But the more we learn about air pollution, the more there is to address.\nA semi-tangential point I wanted to make about the previous post: progress, in terms of air pollution, can be difficult to measure. Once upon a time, as I pointed out, Chicago (and lots of major American cities) had what we\u2019d consider now to be unimaginable levels of pollution. One piece I came across suggested that Chicago housewives buy electric clothes-dryers because the particulate pollution would soil any clothes left outside to dry.\nIn the study, women who were exposed to higher levels of ambient particulate matter (PM) over the long term experienced more decline in their cognitive functioning over a four-year period. Higher levels of long-term exposure to both coarse PM (PM2.5-10) and fine PM (PM2.5) were associated with significantly faster cognitive decline.\nThere are few recent studies that analyze air pollution and cognitive function in older adults, but this is the first study to examine change in cognitive function over a period of time and whether exposure to the size of particulate matter is important.\nShort-term exposure (for up to 7 days) to all major air pollutants, with the exception of ozone, is significantly associated with an increased risk of heart attack, according to a review and meta-analysis of previous studies appearing in the February 15 issue of JAMA.\nWhen pollution in Chicago was so bad that it blocked the sun, one concern doctors had for the youth was that children would be harmed by lack of exposure to its rays. The sun\u2019s back out, but we\u2019re learning a lot more about what we can\u2019t see.",

    "text": "Security company Imperva released a grim study last month suggesting that costly security suites may not be worth the price tag and that all anti-virus programs suffer from huge blind spots. Doom-and-gloom research like this always requires a hefty grain of salt, but after speaking with numerous industry experts an entire shaker might be necessary.\nImperva looked at a variety of security solutions from such vendors as Kaspersky, Avast, AVG, Microsoft, and McAfee, to name a few. They pitted these sentinels against 82 randomly collected malware samples, examining how successful the security software was in detecting the rogue software.\nFrom their work, Imperva asserts that anti-malware software is not fast or responsive enough to combat modern threats. Security software, writes Imperva, is \"much better at detecting malware that spreads rapidly in massive quantities of identical samples, while variants that are of limited distribution (such as government sponsored attacks) usually leave a large window of opportunity.\"\nThey also found no correlation between the money users spend on virus protection and the security provided by software, and suggest that both individual and enterprise customers look at freeware alternatives.\nThe study has garnered a lot of attention, but when speaking with security professionals, and some of the companies named in the study, Security Watch found many who believe the study to be deeply flawed.\nJust about every lab or security company felt that Imperva's sample size of malware was too small to support the conclusions made by the study. AV-Test's Andreas Marx told us that his firm receives about a million samples of new, unique malware per week. Similarly, Peter Stelzhammer from AV-Comparatives told us that they receive 142,000 new malicious files each day.\nFor their part, Imperva wrote in the study that they intentionally used a small sampling, but insist that it is demonstrative of existing threats. \"Our selection of malware was not biased but was randomly taken from the Web reflecting a potential method for constructing an attack,\" writes Imperva.\nNSS Labs research director Randy Abrams, however, had a sharply different interpretation of Imperva's methodology. \"Searching for filenames is guaranteed to miss sophisticated attacks and most other malware too,\" Abrams told Security Watch, commenting on the means Imperva used to locate malware for the study. \"Focusing on Russian forums significantly biases the sample collection. It is obvious that no thought went into obtaining a real-world, representative samples set.\"\nTo carry out their study, Imperva used the online tool VirusTotal to perform their tests which was cited as a critical weakness of the test. \"The problem with this test is that it ripped threats, in the form of executable files, and then scanned those using VirusTotal,\" said Simon Edwards of Dennis Labs. \"VT is not a suitable system to use when evaluating anti-malware products largely because the scanners used in VT are not supported by additional technology such as web reputation systems.\"\nKaspersky Labs, whose product was used in the study, also questioned the testing methodology employed by Imperva in the experiment. \"When scanning for potentially dangerous files, the VirusTotal service used by Imperva's specialists does not use the full versions of antivirus products, but merely relies on a standalone scanner,\" wrote Kaspersky Labs in a statement issued to Security Watch.\n\"This approach means that the majority of protection technologies available in modern antivirus software are simply ignored. This also affects proactive technologies designed to detect new, unknown threats.\"\nNotably, a portion of VirusTotal's website discourages anyone from using their service in antivirus analysis. The company's 'About' section reads, \"we are tired of repeating that the service was not designed as a tool to perform antivirus comparative analyses [...] Those who use VirusTotal to perform antivirus comparative analyses should know that they are making many implicit errors in their methodology.\"\nAbrams also took a dim view on using VirusTotal to perform the study, saying that the tool can be used to skew results towards those desired by testers. \"Competent, experienced testers know better than to use VirusTotal to assess protection abilities of anything other than a pure command line scanner,\" he said.\nImperva defended the use of VirusTotal in their study. \"The essence of the report is not a comparison of antivirus products,\" writes Imperva. \"Rather, the purpose is to measure the efficacy of a single antivirus solution as well as combined antivirus solutions given a random set of malware samples.\"\nWhile the experts we spoke with agreed that zero-day vulnerabilities and newly created malware are a problem, none supported Imperva's assertions about timing or low detection rates. \"The lowest protection rates during a 'real-world' zero-day test are 64-69 percent,\" Marx told Security Watch. \"On average, we saw a protection rate of 88-90 percent for all tested products, this means, 9 out of 10 attacks will be successfully blocked, only 1 will actually cause an infection.\"\nAnother key conclusion of the Imperva report was that anti-malware software is well understood by malware creators, who tweak their creations to subvert protection systems. \"Attackers understand antivirus products in depth, become familiar with their weak points, identify antivirus product's strong points, and understand their methods for handling the high incidence of new virus propagation in the Internet,\" writes Imperva in the study.\nThe study continues, \"variants that are of limited distribution (such as government sponsored attacks) usually leave a large window of opportunity.\"\n\"The malware guys are really tough, they're strong and intelligent,\" said Stelzhammer. \"A targeted attack is always dangerous.\" But he and others stressed that targeted attacks where the malware is specifically tailored against anti-malware is as rare as it is dangerous.\nThe effort and information required to create a piece of malware to defeat every layer of protection is great. \"Such a test requires a lot of time and skills, so they are not cheap,\" wrote Marx. \"But that's the reason why they are called 'targeted.'\"\nOn this point, Abrams quipped, \"Frankly, I am really not concerned with Stuxnet getting into my computer and attacking a uranium enriching centrifuge at my home or employer's office.\"\nNearly everyone we spoke to agreed, at least in principle, that free anti-malware solutions could provide worthwhile protection for users. However, most disagreed that it was a viable option for enterprise customers. Stelzhammer points out that even if corporate users wanted to use free software, the licensing agreements sometimes prevent them from doing so.\n\"It's not all about detection,\" said Stelzhammer in an interview with Security Watch. \"It's about administration, it's about rolling out to the clients, its about overview. You will not get this with a free product.\"\nAn informed user at home, continued Stelzhammer, could use layers of free software to provide protection comparable to paid software but at the cost of simplicity. \"He can arrange a well protected system with free software, but the biggest advantage of paid software is convenience.\"\nHowever, Edwards of Dennis Labs disagreed with the favorable comparison with free software. \"This is counter to all of our findings over many years of testing,\" said Edwards. \"Almost without exception the best products are paid-for.\" These findings are similar to PC Magazine's testing of anti-malware software.\nSince the publication of the study last month, Imperva has written a blog post defending their position. Speaking to Security Watch, Imperva director of security strategy Rob Rachwald said, \"Any critique focusing on our methodology is missing the reality we see today.\" He went on to say that most data breaches are the result of malware intrusion, which the company sees as proof that the current anti-malware model is simply not working.\nWhile there may be some inherent truth to Imperva's conclusions, none of the experts we spoke with viewed the study positively. \"Typically, I warn against vendor sponsored tests, but if this test had been performed by an independent organization I would warn against the organization itself,\" wrote Abrams of NSS Labs. \"It is rare that I encounter such an incredibly unsophisticated methodology, improper sample collection criteria, and unsupported conclusions wrapped up in a single PDF.\"",

That was the first time in a decade that the total refugee intake from around the world included more Muslims than Christians.\nApart from Christians and Muslims, the denominational breakdown for FY 2018 includes Buddhists (5.2 percent), Hindus (3.1 percent) and Jews (0.5 percent), mostly from Bhutan, Bhutan again, and Russia respectively.\nThe Christian refugees include large contingents of Catholics, Protestants and Pentecostalists from the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 which alone accounts for almost 39 percent of the total number of refugees resettled in the U.S.\nThere are also sizeable numbers of Baptists from Ukraine, Orthodox Christians from Eritrea, and Christians (no denomination specified) from Burma.\nMuslim refugees comprise 2,016 individuals identified simply as Muslim, with Burma (857) and the DRC (324) accounting for the largest groups; 655 Shi\u2019ites, including 504 from Afghanistan; and 486 Sunnis, with Afghans again making up the largest number (226).\nThe U.S. has also admitted 173 Ahmadiyya \u2013 all from Pakistan, a country whose constitution does not recognize Ahmadis as Muslims, and whose penal code criminalizes Ahmadi worship.\nIn recent years the makeup of Syrian refugees in particular became a sensitive issue, both because of overall security concerns but also because so few of those admitted were Christians.\nThat was the case despite the Obama administration\u2019s determination in 2016 that ISIS\u2019 atrocities against Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities in areas under its control amounted to genocide.\nThe disparity was especially stark in FY 2016, when of a total of 12,587 Syrian refugees admitted \u2013 accounting for 1.8 percent of all refugees admitted that year \u2013 12,486 (99.2 percent) were Muslims and 68 (0.5 percent) were Christians, including Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and Catholic.\nAlthough Muslims do significantly outnumber Christians in Syria, the Christian minority nonetheless made up around 10 percent of the total population when the civil war began in 2011.\nIn FY 2017, the U.S. resettled 6,549 Syrian refugees, or 12.2 percent of all refugees admitted that year. Of those Syrians, 6,405 (97.8 percent) were Muslims and 113 (1.7 percent) were Christians.\nIn FY 2018, however, of 60 Syrian refugees admitted \u2013 just 0.27 percent of all refugees admitted this year \u2013 40 (66.6 percent) are Sunni Muslims and 20 (33.3 percent) are Christians.\nPresident Trump came into office vowing to prioritize Christian refugees.\nAlthough his policies have seen a sharp drop in the overall number of refugees admitted to the U.S., the shift in the Christian-Muslim ratio has been marked.\nOverall, FY 2018 has seen the smallest number of refugees admitted to the U.S. (21,561 as of Thursday) in any one year since 1977 (when 19,946 were resettled).\nThree years later, the Refugee Act put the current refugee resettlement program in place. Since 1980, the lowest number of refugees admitted until now was 27,131, in FY 2002.\nThe Trump administration this week proposed a refugee admission cap of 30,000 for FY 2019, the lowest since the legislation was enacted in 1980. It will now consult with Congress before a final determination by the president.",

These are all gearless vehicles which ensure that a cross-section of users can access them,\u201d Ayyadurai explained.\nThe company also plans to leverage the association with Ola to study traffic and the heat map of users to identify potential access points.\n\u201cShort-haul and last-mile commuting is an unsolved problem in mass transportation in India. We believe Vogo can both increase the reach of public transport as well as provide an affordable alternative for areas not yet serviced by it,\u201d Ritesh Banglani, partner at Stellaris Venture Partners, said in the statement.\nThe startup was founded in 2016 by Ayyadurai, Padmanabhan Balakrishnan and Sanchit Mittal. In earlier stints, Ayyadurai and Balakrishnan have worked at Flipkart and Mittal was with online real estate platform Housing.com.\nVogo had raised seed funding in 2016 led by AV Thomas Group chairman Ajit Thomas, executive director at Thiagarajar Mills Hari Thiagarajan, and business head - nutraceuticals at EID Parry Muthu Murugappan.\nThe last-mile connectivity space has seen the entry of a number of docked bike and other two-wheeler rental startups. The bicycle space, though, has not seen much traction and is perceived as a weekend pursuit by users.\nLast month, Alibaba-backed bike-sharing startup Ofo closed down its India operations, just seven months after setting up shop in the country.\nHowever, a number of startups offering two-wheeler rental services have raised venture capital funding in the past few months.\nLast week, Bengaluru-based Wickedride Adventure Services Pvt. Ltd, which rents out premium motorcycles and last mile connectivity solutions, raised $12.2 million (Rs 83.6 crore) in a round co-led by Sequoia Capital India and Accel Partners.\nLast month, bicycle-sharing startup Yulu, founded by Amit Gupta, a co-founder of mobile advertising technology unicorn InMobi, raised at least Rs 8-10 crore ($1.2-1.4 million) in tranches over the past few months from the investors.\nIn January this year, Bengaluru-based self-riding bike rental company Ontrack raised seed investment from Diverse Middle East FZE, a Dubai-based family office.\nIn December 2017, Gurugram-based Mobycy raised $500,000 (Rs 3.2 crore) in a seed round from a US-based angel investor.",

    "text": "As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as administration coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the Stanford University president in early May, I approached the meeting with apprehension.\nThere were good reasons for my concern. That very morning, Harvard had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue on fossil fuel divestment. Last fall, Brown University flatly refused student calls to sever ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at a national and international level had fared no better.\nTogether with three other Fossil Free Stanford organizers, I had strategized for hours about how to respond to the anticipated excuses and delays. But rather than facing hostility when we met the senior assistant, he told us that Stanford was preparing to announce its divestment from the coal industry. The Stanford Board of Trustees had heeded our calls for action, accelerated its review process, and was nearing a decisive vote. I was shocked. Eighteen months of dedication had actually achieved results.\nOur group, Fossil Free Stanford, was founded in November of 2012 as part of a national and international campaign calling on universities and other institutions to divest their endowments from the fossil fuel industry. The movement was inspired by Bill McKibben\u2019s incisive article in Rolling Stone, which provided a call to action and highlighted the terrifying fact that 80 percent of proven fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground in order to slow climate change to a rate that avoids the most catastrophic consequences. The movement for divestment gave my generation, for the first time, a tangible way to take action against climate change. Within months, divestment campaigns had sprung up at more than 300 colleges across the country.\nGet access to more illuminating stories like this one with a digital subscription to The Progressive magazine.\nSubscribe today and get one full year online for just $10!\nStanford\u2019s campaign began with a small group of passionate students and a goal of compelling our university to spear-head a global movement. Led by Sophie Harrison, a remarkable freshman, we researched Stanford\u2019s official policies for evaluating divestment. Our first concrete step was to submit a request for review to the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility and Licensing, a body created during the apartheid divestment campaign of the 1980s to advise the board of trustees.\nAs we navigated the bureaucratic process, momentum toward divestment continued to build within the student body. We created a student petition and went door to door, asking for signatures. The petition allowed us not only to demonstrate student support, but also to engage with and educate our peers. We explained that while divestment would have little direct impact on the share prices of fossil fuel companies, it could fundamentally shift the public and political dialogue on climate change. By divesting, we would begin to align our investments with our values, send the powerful and unequivocal message that climate change is a profoundly moral issue, and make clear to policymakers that doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry is no longer acceptable.\nWhile our contact with the advisory panel continued, the administration held its cards close, and we were uncertain of the precise timeline for its decision-making process. In the fall of 2013, we were given less than one week\u2019s notice that we would have the opportunity to deliver our case to the full advisory panel. Some of the Fossil Free organizers had already been carving twenty hours per week out of their demanding academic workloads, but now we had to put our already sleep-deprived team to the test.\nMembers of the team organized our largest rally to date, which was featured on the front page of the Stanford Daily and sent a strong message of student support. Meanwhile, I spearheaded the effort to craft a comprehensive report detailing the scientific, ethical, and economic underpinnings of our request. Sophie played a crucial role in all aspects of our strategy, writing sections of the report, delivering a rousing speech at the rally, and organizing our formal presentation to the advisory panel.\nAt its core though, Fossil Free remained a student-driven movement. As the year progressed, our core team expanded and the movement\u2019s emblematic orange-felt squares began to appear all across campus. Orange, rather than green, was chosen as the color of the national divestment movement because climate change isn\u2019t merely an environmental issue.\nContinuing to burn fossil fuels may eliminate coral reefs and cause a mass extinction of species, but the devastation won\u2019t be limited to natural systems. Climate change will destroy the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world, particularly in poor and marginalized communities. Those who have done the least to cause the problem are the most likely to be displaced by rising seas, battered by severe storms, or uprooted by drought and famine.\nThis moral argument\u2014that climate change is a matter of social and environmental justice\u2014resonated with the Stanford community.\nOur efforts to expand support among the student body culminated in Divestment Week at the start of this Spring Quarter. It was the largest and most exhausting week of climate action that Stanford has ever seen. It featured thousands of fliers posted across campus, daily rallies, and dozens of group coffee dates to educate potential supporters. It concluded with an undergraduate student referendum that demonstrated an overwhelming 78 percent support for divestment.\nAll of our efforts were designed to build toward the Stanford Board of Trustees meeting in June. That is why in early May, sitting in the office of the president\u2019s assistant, I was not expecting to hear the words: \u201cStanford is divesting.\u201d But once I had recovered from the initial shock of that pronouncement, my mind began to race forward.\nStanford is a globally renowned institution, and its decision to join the eleven small colleges that have already made a commitment to divest lends tremendous momentum to the movement. What the planet needs is for other institutions to follow Stanford\u2019s lead.\nUniversities and churches, local governments and charities, foundations and civic organizations now have a historic opportunity. By divesting from fossil fuels, each institution can demonstrate that funding catastrophic climate change is inconsistent with its values and mission, and together these institutions can make a collective moral statement that cannot be ignored.\nSo while Stanford\u2019s decision to divest is a momentous victory for my generation, it marks not the end of our campaign, but a continuing call to action. The history of national and global efforts to combat climate change provides many reasons to be cynical, but for the first time, a powerful movement is rising to challenge the status quo.\nWorking with Fossil Free Stanford for the past year and a half has rekindled my hope for a sustainable future. It has also convinced me that a group of thoughtful and committed citizens really can change the world.",

    "text": "Ladies and gentleman, may we introduce Dax Shepard, feature film writer/director. The star of Idiocracy and Zathura has written and co-directed Brother\u2019s Justice, a mockumentary in which he also stars as himself, shopping around a movie pitch in which he\u2019ll play a martial arts action star. Featuring Tom Arnold, Jon Favreau, Ashton Kutcher and Bradley Cooper, the film is currently on the festival circuit and seeking distribution. Check out the trailer after the jump.\nAs a fan of films filled with inside Hollywood jokes, I think Brother\u2019s Justice certainly has potential. If Shepard and co-director David Palmer are able to blend biting cultural commentary with the obvious physical goofs that the premise lends itself too, there\u2019s no reason the film can\u2019t be a hilarious exercise in meta.\nWhat I find more fascinating, though, is how this film is another example of the cultural significance of Punk\u2019d. In recent years, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s MTV show has turned into a punchline, but it certainly was an incredible Hollywood springboard. B.J. Novak, for example, went from the candid camera show to writing and executive producing The Office and starring in Inglourious Basterds. Ryan Pinkston turned it into a nice little career with roles in Spy Kids 3D, Bad Santa and a bunch of TV. Shepard, however, was the breakout star, using the show to acquire starring roles in Idiocracy, Zathura, Employee of the Month and he even married his When In Rome co-star, Veronica Mars herself, Kristin Bell. He\u2019s currently on the NBC show Parenthood.\nAnd now he\u2019s used all of those connection to make his own movie. And whether or not the film is good, the fact remains, the guy made a movie. You\u2019ve got to give him respect for that, right?\nWhat do you make of this trailer? Does it make you want to see it or do you feel the mockumentary genre is totally played out?",

French archaeologists, who found the mummy crouched in a fetal position, have been careful to preserve the integrity of the remains by keeping it in the same configuration as when it was discovered.\nThe new exhibition at the Musee de Confluences in Lyon will explore various human representations of death in different ages and cultures from around the world.\nTwo years ago, archaeologists from the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles excavated the 600 hectare Pachacamac site, where they found 70 bodies similar to the one on display. This mummy was found scattered around the bodies in the 1,000-year-old tomb, and they may have been ritually sacrificed.\nThe Ichma peoples lived in the region from 800 A.D. to 1450 A.D. where they constructed 17 pyramids and worshipped the god Pacha Kamaq.

March. 21, 2018 07:56. enhanced@donga.com.\nThe research team at the Center for Gas Analysis under the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) has secured grounds for the inflow of Chinese-born ultrafine particles into South Korea and its research result will be published in the journal Atmospheric Environment in April.\nUltrafine particles are usually emitted when burning fossil fuels and biomass fuels such as firewood. It was difficult, however, to find evidence that the ultrafine particles were from China as such particles found in China and those found in South Korea were similar in their components. China also took a stance that scientific evidence is necessary to prove that the ultrafine particles in South Korea were from China.\nThe Korean research team has focused on the fact that a considerable amount of ultrafine particles is generated during the Chinese New year as a result of fireworks. During the Chinese New Year, the concentration of ultrafine particles on the Korean Peninsula appeared to be generally \u201cbad,\u201d with 51\u223c100\u03bcg (1\u03bcg is one-millionth of a gram) per m\u00b3.\nAs such, the research team has developed a system to gauge two types of concentration \u2013 potassium and laevoglucose \u2013 among components of ultrafine particles. While potassium is emitted when burning both fireworks and biomass, laevoglucose is only emitted when burning biomass. As a result of observation, potassium concentration skyrocketed by more than seven times during the Chinese New Year period whereas laevoglucose concentration did not change. In other words, the research result has proved that Chinese-born ultrafine particles flow into South Korea.\nThe Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources investigated and revealed that 87 percent of heavy metals in yellow dust in South Korea was from China in 2016 but the latest research result is the first time to secure basis of ultrafine particles inflow from China.",

I have an app (cardio trainer) that I use to keep track of my mileage when I run or ruck. It also keeps track of calories burned but obviously it is not the primary reason for my workouts. It is a fun motivator though. My question is, do you know of any sort of calorie conversion for ruck marching? The app tells me how many I burned for walking 5 miles (and I realize that is just an estimate, but I assume I burn a lot more calories carrying a 40 pound ruck the same distance. It would just be fun to know how many?\nGreat question and thanks! I do not know the weighted walk conversions BUT I would guess it would be similar to if you weighed an extra 40 lbs you would burn more calories. As you know a 250 lbs person burns more calories walking than a 200 lbs person.\nI just went to a calorie calculator online and did a 60 min walk at 4 miles per hour for my weight of 200lbs \u2014 I burn 468 calories. With 50lb pack I would weigh 250lbs and I would burn 585 calories for the same pace.\nSo it looks like you can add in 100\u2013150 calories by adding a 40\u201350 lb back pack to a 4 mph walk.\nSince walking with a ruck at 4mph is the bare minimum standards for military rucking \u2014 here is a good test if you put out a little more. Try 5mph or a 12 min mile with 40lbs. Still not blazing fast but a better indicator of effort with /\u200b without a ruck. If you input a 60 min jog at 5 miles per hour for a weight of 200lbs \u2014 I burn 768 calories. With 50lb pack I would weigh 250lbs and I would burn 960 calories for the same pace.\nSo it looks like you can add in 100\u2013200 calories by adding a 40\u201350 lb back pack to a fast walk/\u200bjog depending on your weight and pace.\nNow there is a calorie burning standard for backpacking, which is typically a weighted stroll at a much slower pace of 1\u20132 mph. At my weight of 200 lbs, I burned 670 calories \u201cbackpacking\u201d and 840 calories burned if I place an extra 50lbs on me. So \u2014 yes it makes sense that you would burn more calories by either going faster than \u201cbackpacking pace\u201d which I would average out at 4\u20135 mph as well as when you are carrying even more weight in a ruck.\nSo a precise answer is tough as this is a bit all over the place. I think a safe calorie estimate for rucking with 40-\u200b\u200b50lbs is to add 40 \u2014 50% to what a walking /\u200b jogging calorie burn would be at that pace. So if you are burning 450 calories just walking at 4mph, then you would add 180\u2013225 calories to that number of 450 and get roughly 630 \u2014 675 calories burned an hour with rucking.",

    "text": "As a pet parent who spends way too much time obsessing over stuff that will never happen, there are two things I\u2019m deeply concerned about: 1) the zombie apocalypse and 2) how to keep my dogs safe during the zombie apocalypse. So I\u2019ve developed a plan for this on the off chance I run into walkers right away, like on a trip to the corner store. Here are seven tips to guarantee you and your dogs have a head start on the zombies.\nYour dogs need enough food for the early days of the apocalypse. This is why you\u2019ve bought kibble and treats in bulk: To leave bags and boxes in every room of the house for easy access. You can trust that they\u2019ll knock over, pry open and chew through anything to get to their food, as long as you don\u2019t have it locked away like it\u2019s the Hope Diamond.\nOr even into the fridge.\nYou could also practice counter-surfing encouragement for dogs that don\u2019t come by it naturally.\nMost pet parents train their dogs not to drink from the toilet, but your dogs need that source of fresh water. Begin toilet training them now in ways you\u2019d never otherwise consider: lift, drink, flush, repeat. Check out this video for starters.\nTeach the dogs that under no circumstances should they bite a walker. No one is sure if pets and other animals can be infected with zombie cooties but think: If they could, would you want to see this?\nThis is a super-important lesson, and luckily it comes naturally. We\u2019ve all seen our dogs do the stop, drop and roll.\nStop: I smell something disgusting!\nDrop: I must schmooze my face alllll over it!\nRoll: I must embrace the full disgustingness of the stankiness with my entire body! Yes! Yessss!\nFrom this we get the perfect zombie disguise.\nThis is the best disguise for your dogs to use against zombies because the dogs will now smell just like walkers. In an early Walking Dead episode, Rick and Glenn covered themselves in killed zombie guts so they could go out among the walkers undetected, and it worked.\nFor full protection from zombie cooties, here\u2019s where the onesies come in. You must train the dogs to roll in the nasty stuff only when they\u2019re wearing their special apocalypse gear so that the gunk doesn\u2019t get on their fur.\nWhen the dog onesies are soaked in gross, stinky stuff, do not wash them. Simply hang them on low hooks around the house so your dogs can wriggle into them before venturing outside. Dogs can be taught to dress themselves \u2014 some even come by it naturally.\nDogs can run circles around anything, so confusing walkers should be no problem. A single dog can circle a walker until it gets dizzy and falls over (the walker, not the dog), and two or more dogs can confuse an entire pack of walkers, giving the dogs plenty of time to make an escape. Even a medium-sized dog can knock over a healthy person, so with the right training, it can easily knock walkers over.\nOur larger dog can hurl herself across the living room, land on a sofa weighing half a ton and shove it back toward the windows, creating an effective barricade. With your guidance, dogs can develop ideas on how to surf a sofa or bookcase or \u2014 with a little creativity \u2014 major appliance to block further walker access.\nSo teaching them to pile furniture or other household objects in front of doors and windows should be easy enough.\nOnce they\u2019ve set up the house the way they like it, they\u2019ll wait faithfully for your return.\nCongratulations! You made it through the first hours, days or even weeks, and now you\u2019re home. Your dogs have defended your abode with bravery and sheer animal desperation.\nAlong with zombie-proofing the perimeter, you can improve on the dogs\u2019 attempt at home defense, reinforce their training and generally try to make sense of the new normal for yourself and your pets. With our pre-apocalypse tips and your guiding hand, you and your dogs can become a lean, mean, zombie-fighting team and survive and thrive until the cure is found.\nTell us: What would you do to help your pets survive the zombie apocalypse?",

It took around 10 years to complete due to funding issues and several alterations were made by Mackintosh during the process.\nMore than a century later, it still operates as a working building serving hundreds of students.\nIndications are the firefighters' efforts today have ensured more than 90% of the structure is \"viable'' and up to 70% of contents protected, according to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.\nAssistant Chief Officer Dave Boyle said: \"Crews have been working absolutely flat out throughout this very challenging incident and it is clear their effort and skill has saved this treasured building and many of the items it housed.\n\"While the priority from the outset was to save life we have also been working closely with Glasgow School of Art staff to ensure firefighters conducted an effective salvage operation.\nCrews will remain at the scene throughout the night dampening down hot spots, a spokeswoman for the fire service said.\nFlames could be seen through the scorched windows and billowing out of the roof of the sandstone building on the corner of the city's Renfrew Street and Scott Street as the fire took hold.\nLarge crowds gathered near the scene as multiple fire crews tackled the blaze, with several people crying as they watched the events unfold.\nBroadcaster Muriel Gray, a former student and current chairwoman of the school, was among those who burst into tears when she saw the building in flames.\nShe said: \"It's been an absolutely devastating day for everyone involved with the School of Art, students who are preparing for their degree show and all the staff.\n\"We just want to make it clear that we are so grateful to the fire service who responded within four minutes and there were no casualties which is the main thing that we were concerned about.\nIt is hoped that many of the students' work can be saved.\nThe fire prompted an outpouring of concern online from those connected to the school, or who hold affection for it.\nScotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said on Twitter that his thoughts were with staff and students.\nFran Healy, who studied at GSA before becoming lead singer of Travis, expressed his sadness.\nThe Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) tonight described the blaze as \"an international tragedy''.\n\"The most important work by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, an architect of international significance, Glasgow School of Art is held in the highest regard by architects and the public alike - it was rightly judged to be the best building of the past 175 years, in a nationwide poll run by the Royal Institute of British Architects.\nAlex Misick, 25, was helping his girlfriend put the finishing touches to her degree show project across the road in the school's new Reid building when they saw plumes of smoke.\nThe GSA graduate, now vice president of the Students' Association, said: \"I think everyone is in shock. It's soul-destroying.\nEarlier, chief officer Alasdair Hay, of the fire service, said: \"We regularly attend significant fires but the iconic status of this building is not lost on us.\n\"Part of our operation is to try and salvage what we can and we worked with colleagues from the school who identified objects of significance that they would like us, if possible, to save.\nHe could not say what objects were saved.",

    "text": "This combination product contains two medications: ertugliflozin and metformin. These medications belong to the class of medications called oral hypoglycemics.\nErtugliflozin works by increasing the amount of glucose being removed from the body by the kidneys, which decreases the amount of sugar in the blood. Metformin works by reducing the amount of glucose made by the liver and by making it easier for glucose to enter into the tissues of the body.\nThis medication is used by adults with type 2 diabetes to control blood glucose (blood sugar), who are already taking ertugliflozin and metformin as separate tablets and have good glucose control. It may also be used along with metformin or metformin and sitagliptin, if blood glucose hasn't been well controlled on metformin plus the other medication. Ertugliflozin - metformin is intended to be used as part of an overall diabetes management plan that includes diet and exercise.\nEach pink, oval, film-coated tablet, debossed with \"2.5/500\" on one side and plain on the other side, contains 2.5 mg of ertugliflozin and 500 mg of metformin. Nonmedicinal ingredients: carnauba wax, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide red, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide.\nEach pink, oval, film-coated tablet, debossed with \"2.5/1000\" on one side and plain on the other side, contains 2.5 mg of ertugliflozin and 1000 mg of metformin. Nonmedicinal ingredients: carnauba wax, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide red, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide.\nEach red, oval, film-coated tablet, debossed with \"7.5/500\" on one side and plain on the other side, contains 7.5 of mg ertugliflozin and 500 mg of metformin. Nonmedicinal ingredients: carnauba wax, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide red, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide.\nEach red, oval, film-coated tablet, debossed with \"7.5/1900\" on one side and plain on the other side, contains 7.5 mg of ertugliflozin and 1000 mg of metformin. Nonmedicinal ingredients: carnauba wax, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide red, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide.\nThe recommended dose for ertugliflozin - metformin is one tablet taken by mouth twice a day, with meals. Your doctor may adjust the dose up or down, depending on how effective it is and how well it is tolerated. The maximum total daily dose is 15 mg of ertugliflozin and 2000 mg of metformin.\nAlcohol consumption: If you are taking metformin, you should avoid excessive alcohol intake.\nAmputation: There may be an increased risk for lower leg or toe amputations in people taking this medication, especially if you are at high risk for heart disease. Good foot care is very important for people with diabetes. Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you notice symptoms of leg pain, poor circulation, bluish, cold skin, and poor hair or toenail growth.\nDehydration: Ertugliflozin - metformin may cause a decrease in the amount of fluid in your body. Dehydration can cause decreased kidney function, which in turn, reduces the effectiveness of this medication. It can cause decreased blood pressure, which may cause dizziness or fainting. Severely decreased blood pressure also contributes to heart problems. Certain other medications, such as diuretics (water pills) can cause dehydration. If you experience symptoms of dehydration, such as thirst, decreased urine or tear production, dizziness, or headaches, contact your doctor.\nDiabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Ertugliflozin has been associated with DKA. This is a potentially life-threatening condition which occurs when there isn't enough insulin in the blood to use the glucose in the bloodstream. When this happens, the body starts to burn ketones for fuel and can make the blood acidic. This condition is more likely to develop if you are following a very low carbohydrate diet, are dehydrated, or have consumed a large amount of alcohol. Symptoms of DKA include difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, and unusual fatigue or sleepiness. If you experience these symptoms, get immediate medical help, even if your blood glucose level is normal.\nBlood pressure: Some people taking ertugliflozin may experience decreases in blood pressure. This occurs because the medication causes an increased amount of fluid to be removed from the body through the kidneys along with the glucose. These blood pressure drops could lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, and falls. This may occur when you shift your body position, such as rising from a sitting or lying position. If you experience this problem, try getting up more slowly. If it persists or if you faint, contact your doctor.\nGlucose control: When ertugliflozin is taken along with other medications for diabetes, glucose levels may drop too far, causing confusion, cold sweats, cool and pale skin, headache, fast heartbeat, or weakness. Ertugliflozin - metformin should not be used with insulin. If you take other medications for diabetes, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.\nKidney function: The effectiveness of ertugliflozin depends on kidney function. Over time, this medication may cause kidney problems. If you experience signs of kidney problems, such as puffy hands, face or feet, high blood pressure, unusual muscle cramping, or darkened urine, this medication may be affecting how well your kidneys are working. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor as soon as possible.\nDecreased kidney function or kidney disease can cause metformin to build up in the body, causing side effects. If you have reduced kidney function or kidney disease, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.\nLactic acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious problem that occurs due to metformin accumulation (i.e., the body doesn't get rid of it fast enough) during treatment. If you have severe kidney disease you are at higher risk of developing lactic acidosis. Since alcohol may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, do not drink a lot of alcohol over the short- or long-term while taking this medication. When it does occur (very rarely), it is fatal in 50% of cases. If you experience symptoms of lactic acidosis (e.g., weakness, tiredness, drowsiness, unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, stomach pain with nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, feeling cold, dizziness, light-headedness, or slow or irregular heartbeat), stop taking this medication and get immediate medical attention.\nThyroid Function: Metformin can cause a decrease in thyroid stimulating hormone, the messenger that causes thyroid hormone to be produced by the body, if the thyroid gland is not working properly. If you have decreased thyroid function, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.\nIf you develop symptoms of decreased thyroid function, such as unexpectedly feeling cold, depression, constipation or fatigue, let your doctor know.\nUrinary Tract Infections: Ertugliflozin has been associated with serious urinary tract infections, including kidney infections and blood infections caused by bacteria spreading from the urinary tract. If you experience symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as a burning feeling when you urinate, pain or pressure in your back or lower abdomen, cloudy, dark, bloody or strange-smelling urine, or fever or chills, contact your doctor as soon as possible.\nVitamin B12 levels: Metformin may decrease vitamin B12 levels. Your doctor will monitor your B12 levels with blood tests while you are taking this medication.\nYeast infections: There is an increased risk of developing genital or vaginal yeast infections when taking ertugliflozin as a result of increased glucose in the urine. This is more likely to occur for uncircumcised men and for people who have a history of yeast infections.\nBreast-feeding: It is not known if ertugliflozin passes into breast milk. Metformin passes into breast milk. If you are a breast-feeding mother and are taking this medication, it may affect your baby. Breast-feeding is not recommended when you are taking this medication.",

    "text": "Climate|COP24, the New Round of Global Climate Talks, Has Begun. We Answer Three Key Questions.\nCOP24, the New Round of Global Climate Talks, Has Begun. We Answer Three Key Questions.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With the world still struggling to get global warming under control, diplomats from nearly 200 countries are scheduled to meet in Poland over the next two weeks to try to put global climate negotiations back on track.\nThe focus of the meeting? To hammer out a key set of rules for the Paris climate agreement that, delegates hope, will help prod countries to cut fossil-fuel emissions far more deeply in the years ahead than they\u2019re currently doing.\nUnder the Paris deal, signed by world leaders in 2015, virtually every country on Earth agreed to submit a plan for curbing emissions and vowed to ratchet up efforts over time. But key questions about how that process would unfold were left unanswered: How thoroughly should countries report their progress on emissions? How detailed should their plans for making further cuts be?\nDelegates at the conference \u2014 being held in Katowice, at the heart of Poland\u2019s coal-mining region, and which is known as COP24, shorthand for its formal name \u2014 will haggle over a \u201crule book\u201d that will lay out the answers to those and other key questions. The debates are often technical, but highly contentious: China, for instance, has suggested that developing countries should be held to looser reporting standards, but Europe and the United States have pushed back.\nThe stakes are high: While countries agreed in Paris to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels, the plans that various countries have written so far are wildly insufficient to that task. Currently, the world is on pace for around 3 degrees Celsius of warming or more, bringing far higher risks of deadly heat waves, floods, the collapse of polar ice caps and other potential calamities.\nWhat\u2019s more, some countries are now backsliding. The Trump administration has disavowed the Paris deal and plans to pull the United States out by 2020, though the country will nonetheless send officials to Poland to participate in talks. Australia and Brazil also have newly elected leaders opposed to more forceful climate action, and some analysts are now finding signs of a \u201cTrump effect\u201d that could undermine global efforts on climate change.\nWhat\u2019s the point of these climate talks?\nTo understand the Katowice meeting, it\u2019s useful to recall that the Paris climate agreement was largely intended to work through peer pressure among nations.\nUnder the Paris agreement, countries aren\u2019t required to submit legally binding plans for reducing emissions. Instead, each country submits a voluntary plan tailored to its own domestic situation. This structure, the architects of the Paris deal said, was the most realistic way to get every world leader to agree to participate.\nBut those architects also realized that countries aren\u2019t doing nearly enough to keep the world below 2 degrees Celsius of warming. So, under Paris, countries are required to meet periodically, assess their collective progress and see where stronger action can be taken. World leaders could then push each other to ratchet up their ambitions over time.\nBut for this peer-pressure dynamic to have any chance of working, analysts say, countries will need to track and report their progress on curbing emissions in a transparent, standardized way. And they\u2019ll need to offer much more detail on how they intend to cut fossil-fuel emissions in the future, so that outside experts can scrutinize their plans and point out exactly where current climate policies are falling short.\nRight now, this is often difficult to do. For instance, many countries, like Indonesia, have pledged to reduce their emissions below a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d trajectory. But without a clearer sense of what counts as business as usual, it can be hard to track how much these countries are really doing.\nSo, in Katowice, negotiators will hash out these thorny details, like how rigorously countries should track their progress or what level of outside scrutiny future pledges should face. One current draft of the negotiating text is 236 pages long, and, according to an analysis by Carbon Brief, contains more than 3,700 items where countries still disagree on wording. Negotiators have until Dec. 14 to resolve all of them.\nWhat are the big disagreements?\nThe rule book is expected to provoke fierce debate. Some developing countries have argued that they should be given much more leeway in how they report and track their progress, especially if they have limited technical capacity to measure their emissions. China, in particular, has long been wary of outside scrutiny.\nOther countries, like the United States and Europe, are leery of holding countries like China, India and others to a lower standard because developing nations account for 60 percent of global emissions today.\nMoney is another perennial sticking point. India and African countries, for example, have long insisted that wealthy nations need to provide more financing to help poorer governments shift to clean energy or adapt to the impacts of global warming. They have pushed for much more detailed pledges on aid.\nLooming over all these debates is the uncertain role of the United States, which played a critical part in bringing countries together to finalize the initial Paris agreement in 2015.\nWhile the State Department is still sending a team to negotiate the rule book, the Trump administration has largely repudiated the Paris deal and has refused to send an additional $2 billion in climate aid that had been pledged by the Obama administration at Paris. It is still unclear how much influence the United States will have at this newest round of talks, or whether any other countries might step in to take a leadership role.\n\u201cThe global political environment is really challenging right now, with nationalism taking hold in many countries,\u201d said Samantha Gross, a fellow in the Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate, in a recent telephone call with reporters.\nHow will this affect climate change?\nThe most important work on climate change policy will continue to be done by national and local governments around the world; by private businesses, investors and individuals; and by scientists and engineers developing clean-energy technologies.\nIn that regard, few countries are expected to come to Poland with sweeping new climate policy announcements. For instance, Germany, which has been discussing when to set a date for phasing out its coal consumption, has postponed any major decision until after the meeting.\nOne big question is whether the negotiators will wrap up the talks with a strong rule book in hand. Under the Paris deal, countries have informally agreed to consider revising their near-term emissions pledges by 2020 to make them stronger. Analysts will be watching to see if countries emerge from Katowice with a clear intent to increase their ambitions, or if the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to tackle climate change might persuade other leaders to slacken their own efforts.\nIf negotiators at Katowice struggle to agree on a robust rule book, or the talks deadlock entirely, that could further sap global momentum for climate action.",

    "text": "Alexis Debat\u2019s Pentagon Links: Did the Discredited ABC Consultant Get DOD Money Too?\nAs Mother Jones first reported last week, Alexis Debat, the terrorism expert and former ABC News consultant who published alleged interviews with the likes of Barack Obama that he had not in fact conducted, has claimed to associates over the past year to have received \u201ca large chunk of money\u201d from the Pentagon for a study concerning radical Islam. I have since been told that Debat was preparing a study on Islamic warfare, and that his client, albeit indirectly, was Andrew Marshall, head of the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Net Assessment, a kind of in-house think tank.\nHere\u2019s the story. On September 17, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Karen Finn, a spokeswoman for the policy office, told me that the Defense Department did not have a direct contract with Debat, but \u201cDOD does have a contract with the company [Debat] works for \u2026 I suggest you contact his employer for additional information.\u201d The employer she referred me to was the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA), a think tank headed by defense analyst Andrew Krepinevich (Debat also, until last week, had a relationship with the Nixon Center, a think tank that describes itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s realist voice\u201d).\nKrepinevich did confirm that the contract in question was from the Pentagon Office of Net Assessment, but would not reveal the exact topic.

It's called Share and it's on board two Princess Cruises ships.\nThe Australian chef didn't agree to go from his tiny, hyper-seasonal L.A. restaurant to cruise ship partner right away.\n\"How could I do a restaurant on a ship?\" asked Stone. \"It doesn't make sense at all. But hearing more about their ability to change things around, it started to become more interesting.\n\"I look around today and they've done it.\" said Stone, sitting at one of the tables at Share on the Ruby Princess cruise ship docked at the San Pedro harbor on Sunday, the restaurant's opening day. Under his feet were hardwood floors accented by striped carpet; chairs were covered in plush suede; and the decor looked appropriate for a sleek bachelor pad somewhere in Manhattan.\nThere is another Share restaurant on board the Emerald Princess and a third location is being developed on the Sun Princess, the line's ship in Australia.\nMaude, which changes its menu every month, focuses on a single ingredient at a time. At Share, Curtis says that the sourcing and production is different, but he's still focusing on the ingredients.\n\"For the menu, we say where is the ship sailing from,\" said Stone. \"What ingredients does that purveyor have? We reach out, we get samples and start there.\"\nStone credits the crew for figuring out the best way to transport certain ingredients to keep them fresh. For instance, tomatoes are kept in a climate-controlled area, in the dark.\n\"They're really good at getting the most out of what they get,\" said Stone of the cruise line. \"It's our job to craft something that's not only delicious but really executable as well.\"\nChristian Dortch, whom Stone pulled from the line at Maude, is overseeing the culinary operations at both Share locations as the corporate chef.\nThe restaurants will offer a menu that includes a choice of appetizer, main course, sides and dessert. At $39 per person, this is the least expensive Curtis Stone meal available; the tasting menu at Maude will set you back about $80, not including wine.\nAt Share, everything is made on the ship, including dishes such as tagliatelle pasta with Alaskan king crab; twice-cooked duck with bacon jus; and roast turbot white fish with a Gruyere crumb and white vermouth sauce.\nMaude sommelier and General Manager Ben Aviram selected the wines featured on the menu at Share, where the price for a bottle of wine ranges from $28 to $96.\nIn terms of kitchen equipment, Stone says \"the sky is the limit.\"\n\"The only thing that they haven't come good on \u2014 and only because it's impossible \u2014 is a lobster tank,\" said Stone, who also boasted that he's using Pacojets to make the restaurant's ice cream.\nStone also designed some dishes for the main dining rooms on the ships and trained some of the other chefs on board.\nThe Share restaurants are part of a $450-million effort by the cruise line to spruce up its fleet of ships. Also included in the revamp is the Salty Dog gastropub inside the Wheelhouse bar on the Ruby Princess (and other select ships), which partnered with Plan Check chef and partner Ernesto Uchimera.\nKnown for his burgers topped with ketchup leather and his own version of American cheese, Uchimura is making an Ernesto Burger on the boat, made with a freshly ground patty of rib-eye and short rib topped with grilled pork belly, Gruyere, caramelized kimchi, a beer-battered jalapeno, charred onion aioli and smoked salt and pepper on a brioche bun.\nIf you'd like a seat at either restaurant, at least for now, you'll have to book a cruise.",

The cloud has led to an explosion of new apps, but (to pick two random examples) chip design and medical imaging apps are still running on old-fashioned servers.\nNaturally, that\u2019s a problem that Manglik is trying to solve with Cliqr, which is coming out of stealth mode today. The company has raised a seed round of just under $1 million from Google Ventures and Foundation Capital, and it\u2019s raising a Series A now.\nCliqr is supposed to take the headache out of moving these business apps onto the cloud. Manglik says that as business apps are doing more and more computation on more and more data, they\u2019re straining against the resources of on-premise servers. On the cloud, those enterprises could scale their computing resources as needed, but there are still obstacles, like the complexity and cost of the migration.\nManglik makes it sound like there are already plenty of businesses interested in Cliqr\u2019s technology, but I also wondered about the company\u2019s long-term prospects. After all, it\u2019s focused on a specific transition, so will it still be relevant in a few years? Manglik says yes, because there are other advantages to Cliqr\u2019s approach. For one thing, applications are now \u201cunhooked from infrastructure,\u201d you can use the service to move from cloud to cloud. Do pricing changes make you want to move your app from Amazon to Rackspace? With Cliqr, you should be able to switch with a click.",

    "text": "Elevate combines algorithmic recommendations from LinkedIn Pulse and Newsle, as well as human curation, to suggest content employees could share.\nSome of the most powerful brand advocates are the ones holding company business cards. LinkedIn wants to harness this, launching a new product \u2014 Elevate \u2014 that allows companies to curate and share company content, and measure the effectiveness.\nFor example, when a LinkedIn member shares six pieces of content, on average, they receive six profile views and make two new connections, which helps them strengthen their professional brands. At the same time, the company they work for receives six job views, three Company Page views, and one Company Page follower, which helps them better hire, market, and sell. Despite that, our research shows that only 2% of employees share content their company has shared on LinkedIn. Yet they drive tremendous value. They\u2019re responsible for about 20% of the overall engagement \u2013 clicks, likes, comments, and shares \u2013 that content receives. That\u2019s not surprising given employees have 10 times more connections than their company has followers, and people tend to be considered more authentic than companies.\nElevate can be accessed though desktop, as well as apps on iOS and Android. It allows employees to schedule content posting when their networks are most active. Elevate combines algorithmic recommendations from LinkedIn Pulse and Newsle, as well as human curation, to suggest content employees could share.\nThis product helps our employees start social conversations about Adobe and the industries we serve. Adobe employees who participated in the LinkedIn Elevate pilot drove 80 percent more Adobe job views than they did previously and in February alone, each participant drove three to four new trial downloads for Adobe solutions. Our employees want to be active on social media, and LinkedIn Elevate offers an easy platform to provide them with insightful content that they will want to share.\nReaders: What do you think of companies prompting employees to post content?",

All three clubs denied wrongdoing.\nFormer Cameroon international Jean-Claude Mbvoumin, who has set up the Culture Foot Solidaire group to fight the trafficking of minors, says that young African players are still brought to Europe by false agents.\nHe told Reuters last year that families sometimes hand over their life savings to the agents hoping to secure a move to a top club, only for their sons to be abandoned on the streets of Europe.\nFIFA is also facing a legal complaint at the European Commission from the world players\u2019 union FIFPro, which says that the current transfer regulations have led to a lack of competition in the sport.",

Wester said Tuesday.\nWester called on Congress and New Mexico\u2019s congressional delegation to pass legislation that would restore the program.\nIn a phone interview Tuesday, Wester called a bipartisan DREAM Act \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d that Congress can approve, even if it can\u2019t agree on comprehensive immigration reform.\n\u201cIt seems this is somethings we can wrap our minds around and get done,\u201d Wester said.\nWester also said he senses anxiety among young people registered through the DACA program in New Mexico.\n\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous worry,\u201d he said. The youths trusted the government enough to register and provide personal information, only to learn that the U.S. now may violate that trust, he said.\n\u201cNow they are very vulnerable because we know where they are, who they are,\u201d he said.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions today declared the Obama administration\u2019s program \u201can unconstitutional exercise of authority\u201d that must be revoked. The administration is giving Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before the government stops renewing permits for people already covered by the program.\nWester called for New Mexicans to urge their elected leaders to pass a bipartisan DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform.\n\u201cI am deeply troubled by the president\u2019s decision today to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects more than 800,000 young immigrants from deportation,\u201d Wester said in his statement. \u201cIn my judgment, DACA has stood as a counterpoint to the voices of exclusion and now, without the action of Congress, this crucial support for these young immigrants has been taken away.",

    "text": "Does Age Predict Technology Adoption?\nA common perception is that \u2018older people\u2019 (whatever age that is) do not adopt technology as quickly as younger users. It appears some preferences may be ageless. Consider the e-book or e-reader. Whether a Kindle, Nook, Sony or another manufacturer, one might assume that these pieces of high-tech must be in high-demand by nearly everyone but especially among younger users. While Pew has reported e-book reader sales rising, new data from Rasmussen suggests that the printing press may have a few more years to go.\nAccording to Rasmussen three out of four Americans still prefer books over today\u2019s e-books. Approximately 75% enjoy paper, 15% enjoy digital format and another 10% are undecided. The number of paper users does not waiver much based upon book buying habits, 74% of those who bought a book in the last month prefer bound text to screen reading. Here is where it gets interesting. Despite the digital divide in other tech domains, the generations are remarkably aligned in their preference to read \u201ctraditional print format\u201d rather than on an \u201celectronic book reading device\u201d. Of survey respondents ages 18-39, 70% prefer hardcopy, as do 79% of middle-aged readers and 78% of consumers 65+. Clearly younger readers are more likely to use an e-reader, 19% compared to only 14% and 10% respectively for consumers 40-64 and those 65 years old and older, but nearly 75% of every age prefers paper.\nWhat accounts for this generational agreement? E-readers are pretty convenient and can lighten the load for those who find it hard to choose which of their summer reading list to take the beach. However, the heft of a book may be an attraction all of its own. Quite possibly readers of all ages enjoy the feel of the book and the act of turning the page. Other fans of paper may still enjoy the taboo act of scribbling on the page. Or, perhaps, sharing a good read feels like more of a gift when handing it off rather than sharing a download.Whatever the reason, these recent data may suggest something I have long suspected. It is not the age of the user but the user\u2019s experience and that predicts acceptance or adoption of a device.\nE-readers provide a unique case study. Most younger buyers never used vinyl, 8-tracks, cassettes, or as painful as it may be for anyone over 30 to hear, CDs, to listen to their music. Young music lovers come fresh and ready to embrace new media and devices because they have no mental model \u2013 experience and an understanding of how something should look and work \u2013 to reconcile or adjust in order to learn something new. Essentially, they have nothing to give up or relearn in order to adopt something new. Unlike many devices such as MP3 players, i-anything or a never-ending list of apps, younger and older users start out from the same place when considering e-book adoption. Whether you are months old chewing on a picture book or a centenarian reading a favorite novel, we all share an idea of how a book should look and \u2018work\u2019. While convenient, light and in some cases even a cheaper way to buy books, e-books have not presented a compelling value greater than bound paper, ink and glue to younger or older buyers.\nThe slow adoption of e-books by all age groups and research being conducted by my colleagues at the MIT AgeLab suggests that adoption is more likely to be influenced by experience and expectations than by birthdays. As technology advances at an unprecedented rate and completely novel devices, applications and interfaces are introduced; the digital divide based upon age alone is likely to narrow as more of us, regardless of age, are overtaken by the velocity of innovation making more of us tech neophytes. Either that or the term \u2018older consumer\u2019 may get redefined to be much younger \u2013 just think of those future \u2018poor old folks\u2019 in their late 20s struggling to keep up. Designers, engineers, manufacturers and retailers will have to rethink who is a lead adopter, what services, experiences and education they will have to provide along with the technology to ensure understanding of new systems, let alone their purchase and adoption.",

    "text": "VIENNA (AFP) - The top diplomats from Russia, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey will hold talks on the war in Syria on Friday (Oct 23), after Moscow thrust itself into the heart of the conflict with its bombing campaign in support of President Bashar al-Assad.\nThe envoys from Washington, Riyadh and Ankara - all of which back groups battling against Assad - will look to sound out Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Vienna after the embattled Syrian strongman made a surprise visit to Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin this week.\nOn Sept 30, Russia launched air strikes in Syria which have shifted the dynamics of the brutal four-and-a-half year war - allowing Assad's battle-weary forces to go on the offensive and overshadowing a US-led coalition bombing the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group.\nThe US and its regional allies have decried Russia's strikes, insisting Moscow is not mainly targeting ISIS as it claims, but other groups battling the regime in Damascus, and that the Kremlin's intervention will only prolong the fighting.\nAhead of the talks in the Austrian capital, Assad's fate remains a major a stumbling block and, after years of failure to stop the bloodshed in Syria, there was scant hope of any major breakthrough.\nWashington and its regional allies have long insisted Assad has to go for there to be any chance of a political solution to fighting that has cost more than 250,000 lives, but Moscow says it must first help him defeat ISIS and other \"terrorists\" before talks can start on any reforms.\n\"The aim of the US is to get rid of Assad, probably that is so, our aim is to defeat terrorism, to battle terror, and to help President Assad claim victory over terror,\" Putin said on Thursday in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\"In this way, we can then create the conditions for the start and, I hope the successful reaching of a conclusion, of the political process to find a settlement.\"\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry said in Berlin that while all sides agreed on the need to find a political solution and battle ISIS only \"one thing stands in the way... a person called Assad - Bashar al-Assad\".\nAssad's surprise visit to Moscow on Tuesday - his first known trip abroad since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011 - has now placed the Kremlin as the key link to the strongman.\nPutin - who has been isolated by the West for some 15 months over the Ukraine crisis - went on a diplomatic blitz in the wake of the visit by Moscow's long-standing ally, calling the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.\nWhile all sides seem entrenched in their positions, analysts say some Assad opponents seem to be softening their line and conceding that he could remain in power temporarily, while Moscow does not seem wedded to the strongman long-term.\nAnother staunch Assad ally that will not be at the table in Vienna - due to objections mainly from Saudi Arabia - is Iran, but even officials in Tehran say they would not work to keep him in power \"forever\".\nWhile Syria is set to dominate in Vienna, Lavrov and Kerry will also hold talks with representatives from the European Union and United Nations on the latest round of Israeli-Palestinian violence.\nThe talks - to include the EU's foreign policy chief and UN head Ban Ki Moon via video-link - are part of a flurry of diplomatic activity seeking to end weeks of violence that has raised fears of a new Palestinian intifada, or uprising.\nKerry on Thursday expressed \"cautious optimism\" about defusing the crisis after a four-hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Berlin.",

    "text": "MESA, Ariz. \u2014 After an exhausted Javier Baez fell short of carrying his Cubs teammates deep into the playoffs last year, he'll try to strike a balance of leading by performance and example.\n\"I can't do it alone,\" said Baez, who finished second in National League Most Valuable Player voting after producing 34 home runs, 111 RBIs and a .290 batting average. \"I'm sure there are a few guys here with leadership (skills), so we'll just try to stay together and try to get the team to play more together.\"\nBaez believes the Cubs need to play with a sense of urgency in 2019 after their run of three consecutive appearances in the NL Championship Game abruptly ended last year. He said the team didn't react quickly enough as their five-game lead in the NL Central with 28 games remaining disappeared.\n\"After the season was over, after the last game, we started saying what we were missing, and it kind of bothered me,\" Baez said Tuesday. \"That's what the game is for, to make adjustments and get better. We waited until the season was over to look at it and try to make adjustments when there was no tomorrow.\n\"This offseason we had a lot of time to think about it and to see how we're going to react this year.\"\nBaez, 26, who occasionally watches the trajectory of his home runs at home plate, also put himself on notice and said players should hold each other accountable.\n\"Last year, I didn't run full speed to first base and I would get back to the dugout and no one would say anything,\" Baez said. \"This year, if I don't do it, someone will hopefully say something. It's not to show you up. It's to make our team better.\"\nFor example, when reliever Pedro Strop told Baez to quit going through the motions during a rain delay in Kansas City on Aug. 6, that motivated Baez to hit a tiebreaking home run and an RBI double in his next two at-bats.\nWhen it comes to improving at the plate, Baez said he is committed to being more patient.\n\"I'm just trying to get more walks,\" Baez said. \"People are talking about my walks and strikeouts, and it's only going to make me better if I walk more and if I see the ball better.\"\nBaez had the National League's highest first-pitch swing rate at 46.5 percent, and he had 422 swings and misses (third in the majors).\nBaez drew 29 walks in 645 plate appearances in 2018 _ one fewer than in 2017 despite 137 more plate appearances.\n\"He's arrived at this juncture on his own,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"Because when a player brings it up and it's going to be his idea, there's a much better chance of it being fulfilled.\"\nBaez's biceps look noticeably bigger, but he noted that he put added emphasis on conditioning work in the offseason after playing in 160 games last season, including starting 21 of the final 22.\nBaez batted only .256 with one home run in his final 12 regular-season games. He finished with 21 steals and did not steal a base after Aug. 23.\n\"I kind of did get a little tired,\" he said. \"A lot had to do with running the bases and (trying to) get 30 (stolen bases). After the first half, all the teams started to worry about me on the bases, so I was working more and had a lot of pressure on me. I was trying to do too much in the last month. I'll try to make the adjustment on that and try to control myself when I can.\"\nBaez was proud to finish in the top three in NL MVP voting, behind the Brewers' Christian Yelich and ahead of the Rockies' Nolan Arenado.\n\"I just hope and think they should (consider) more defense into it,\" Baez said. \"There's a lot of comments about it. But it's something I can't control. Yelich had a great year, just like me and Arenado. So hopefully I'll be in the top three (in 2019).\"\nI think one of the reasons they lost some of the last games was because of the manager. He put a person in to hit that had never batted before. In a most important game. And then other decisions the manager made was like he didn't want to win or thought they were so good it didn't matter. They were saving players to play later etc. You don't do that when you need them. What good is saving them to play when you don't win??",

    "text": "It's been about a year since smartphone brand Infinix came to India. As an online-only player, it has dished out some pretty interesting offerings so far, the most recent being the Infinix Hot S3 (Review), which also won a coveted spot in our list of best phones under Rs. 10,000.\nThat particular segment is already pretty crowded, with Xiaomi pretty much dominating it. Infinix now has a new model called the Hot 6 Pro, which targets users who are looking for a large display to enjoy content on. It\u2019s priced pretty aggressively at Rs. 7,999, which pits it right against the Xiaomi Redmi 5 (Review). Big display aside, is the Hot 6 Pro a good all-rounder? We review to find out.\nInifinix sent us a Sandstone Black unit of the Hot 6, which looks really slick. The matte finish of the back offers a good grip, and doesn\u2019t attract fingerprints too much. It also contrasts well with the 2.5D curved-edge display. The Hot 6 Pro is available in Magic Gold and Bordeaux Red colour options as well.\nThe Infinix Hot 6 Pro feels fairly light at 158g, with good weight distribution across the entire body. The sides aren\u2019t very slim but that means there's more surface area to grip the phone. The highlight of the phone is of course the display, which measures 5.99 inches diagonally and has an HD+ resolution (720x1440). The display follows the 18:9 aspect ratio, so it's taller with slim borders on the left and right. The screen is bright with a claimed brightness of 500 nits, and colours are vivid and punchy. Text and the edges of icons aren\u2019t the sharpest since the pixel density is only around 268ppi. There\u2019s scratch resistant glass too, by NEG.\nThe power button on the Infinix Hot 6 Pro has a textured surface, making it easy to distinguish it from the volume rocker. There\u2019s a notification LED near the earpiece. On the bottom there's a 3.5mm headphones socket, a Micro-USB port, and a mono speaker. There\u2019s a SIM tray on the left which supports two Nano-SIM cards and a separate microSD card (of up to 128GB).\nThe back of the Infinix Hot 6 Pro is not removable, even though the design seems to suggest otherwise. There\u2019s a centre-mounted fingerprint sensor which is easy to reach, although authentication isn\u2019t very quick and it takes a full second (or a bit more) before the screen actually wakes up. Infinix offers dual cameras at the back, which is something we don\u2019t see too often in this segment. The cameras are horizontally aligned and sit nearly flush with the rest of the body.\nIn the box, you get the usual assortment of accessories such as a Micro-USB cable, power adapter, case, screen guard, and SIM eject tool, but no headset.\nThe guts of the Hot 6 Pro are based around the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 mobile platform, and herein lies one of the biggest issues with this phone. This quad-core SoC is typically found in lower-budget Android phones and is simply no match for what the competition is offering these days. Xiaomi\u2019s Redmi 5 gives you a Snapdragon 450. Other specifications of the Infinix Hot 6 Pro include 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, single-band Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, USB-OTG, FM radio, and proximity, compass, Hall and ambient light sensors.\nInfinix uses its own custom OS skin called Hummingbird XOS v3.2, which is based on Android 8 Oreo. There\u2019s a fairly recent May 2018 security patch applied too. The custom OS looks quite different from stock Android but thankfully, Inifnix hasn\u2019t messed with the functionality too much. For instance, the notifications shade and quick toggle switches can be accessed from the top; a swipe up opens the app drawer; and it\u2019s easy to find what you\u2019re looking for in the Settings app.\nThe Infinix Hot 6 Pro also has some extra apps: a Web browser, a forum app, a 9Gag-style video app, etc, that come pre-loaded and aren't particularly useful, but you can uninstall most of them. XOS also includes some convenience features including a one-handed mode, screen recording, scrolling screenshots, and a Game DnD mode. There isn\u2019t much in terms of gestures as you only get double-tap-to-wake, 3-finger screenshot, and the ability to silence the phone by flipping it over. There\u2019s something called eye-care mode, which is essentially a toggle for Android\u2019s night mode.\nThe Infinix Hot 6 Pro comes with face recognition support for unlocking the phone, but it\u2019s slow and only works under good lighting. If the light isn\u2019t ideal, it simply refuses to work well, and even the fill light from the front LED flash doesn\u2019t help much.\nThe interface runs quite smoothly most of the time, even with various transition animations. There\u2019s some lag when you\u2019re switching between apps, and scrolling through heavy webpages in Chrome can get jerky. Overall, the performance is strictly average and this reflects in benchmarks too. In AnTuTu, we got a score of 44,681, while in gaming benchmarks such as GFXbench\u2019s T-Rex test, we got a frame rate of only 13fps.\nApps take a little longer to load than usual, especially games. We tried popular titles such as Asphalt 8 and PUBG, but the experience wasn\u2019t great. The games automatically dropped graphical details to the lowest settings, and even then, the frame rates felt a bit choppy.\nHowever, Infinix has a clear focus for the Hot 6 Pro which seems to be watching videos, and in this regard, it does a decent job. The display is bright and produces saturated colours. It looks good even outdoors under bright light. It can handle 1080p video playback well. Videos streamed from Prime Video and Netflix at high quality looked good, but weren't as sharp as we would have liked. This cannot be helped though, due to the relatively large display and low pixel count. The speaker gets quite loud and dialogue is audible but bass is lacking and and the mid-range isn't very clear. But the placement of the speaker grille is an issue because your hands may end up blocking it when you hold the phone horizontally.\nThe Infinix Hot 6 Pro features a 13-megapixel primary sensor and a secondary 2-megapixel depth sensor on its rear. Focusing is fairly quick when light is good, but we had better results when we tapped to focus manually rather than leaving that up to the software. Even taking into account the slightly overcast outdoor conditions during our review period, the pictures we were able to capture weren't very good.\nThe details of nearby objects in landscape shots were alright, but pretty much everything else had grainy details, blurry edges, and subdued colours. HDR mode has to be triggered manually and the result was often terrible. Macros weren't much better either, lacking sharpness and detail. There's a portrait mode but despite the depth sensor, edge detection often missed the mark.\nIn low light, the camera hunts for focus and doesn\u2019t lock on very easily. Images mostly turned out grainy and under-exposed. The phone has a 5-megapixel front camera, which surprisingly shoots 1080p video, but the quality of stills and video was strictly average. You get a fill light in the front, which is of some help in the dark. Other shooting modes include panorama, time-lapse, and a professional mode that lets you change the shutter speed, white balance, etc.\nThe Infinix Hot 6 Pro packs in a 4000mAh battery, which typically gave us a full day\u2019s worth of usage on one charge. Oddly, it didn\u2019t fare too well in our internal battery test, lasting for just 7 hours and 25 minutes with continuous video playback. With the bundled 6W charger and even with our own higher powered ones, it took nearly three and half hours to fully charge this phone.\nInfinix might have some gems in its portfolio but the Hot 6 Pro doesn't look like one of them. With all the focus on delivering a large display, the company seems to have neglected other aspects of the phone. The main issue is the SoC, which simply doesn\u2019t cut it at this price anymore. The cameras are underwhelming, security features like face and fingerprint recognition feel sluggish, and battery life, while decent, could have been better for video consumption.\nFor Rs. 1,000 more, you can get the Xiaomi Redmi 5 (Review) or even the Infinix Hot S3 (Review), which offer much better all-round performance.\nproduct Infinix Hot 6 Pro boasts of a large display for video consumption, but is it the complete package? Read our Infinix Hot 6 Pro to find out.",

I\u2019ve eaten dog food and taken most of my clothes off on TV.\n\u201cBut once, when I was on Mastermind, I was asked what the first three words of the Bible were, and I said, \u2018Hello and welcome\u2019.\nBut Horne, a father-of-three from West Sussex, a regular on Channel 4\u2019s 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, confesses there have been plenty of other cringe-making moments in his career.\nOn Taskmaster, where for his new series he will be joined by Bake Off\u2019s Mel Giedroyc and Outnumbered star Hugh Dennis as well as a few up and coming comics, he says: \u201cA lot of the things we make them do, you\u2019d do when you were a kid.\nTurning to his visit to North Wales, the 38-year-old, who began his comedy career while at university, said that they never know what may happen in their music and comedy show, which originally aired on Radio 4, six years ago.\nThe band have also had many years of sell-out shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and London\u2019s West End.\nHorne added: \u201cI\u2019m a stand up comedian and my five friends are musicians - they went into music and I went into comedy, so we decided to create a stand up show with music.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun, if it goes well it\u2019s brilliant - there\u2019s nothing better than being on stage with my friends in front of an audience.\n\u201cWe kind of just muck about for two hours.\n\u201cWe try to mix it up a little bit with music, comedy, dancing and exercise, but no two shows are the same.\n\u201cMost comedy shows have a backbone to the show, we know roughly what we\u2019re going to do and muck about around that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a mixture because if you do the same thing every night, it gets a little bit boring for us so it\u2019s good to mix it up.\n\u201cThe audience love it when things go wrong.

Read on to find out what 11 U.S. presidents did before landing in office.\nRonald Reagan was an actor before taking office as the 40th U.S. president in 1981. He starred in more than 50 movies, was president of the Screen Actors Guild, and was a spokesman for General Electric, which is when he got his start in politics. Before that, Reagan was a sports broadcaster at the University of Iowa, where he was paid $10 per game. He became a radio announcer before working as an announcer for the Chicago Cubs.

We don't want it to be a surprise for people,\" he said on CBC Montreal's Daybreak.\nSimon Jolin-Barrette, who served as the CAQ's justice critic and was re-elected Monday, said the government will make the change as soon as possible, although he didn't provide a clear timeline.\nAre cannabis caf\u00e9s the solution to limits on pot smoking set by Quebec towns and cities?\nBill Blair says the federal government won't interfere if Quebec decides to go through with the increase to the age limit.\nThe minister responsible for border security and organized crime reduction says Ottawa will leave it to the provinces to decide their own age limits.\nLafreni\u00e8re said studies his party has consulted suggest teenagers start smoking pot at 16, but the CAQ was not prepared to set the mininum legal age that low.\nWhen it was suggested that setting the legal age at 21 would create an exclusive market for pot dealers, made up of 18-to 20-year-olds, Lafreni\u00e8re said dealers will be just as happy if the legal age remains 18.\nJean-S\u00e9bastien Fallu, an associate professor of psycho-education at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, said he believes raising the age is a well-intentioned but bad idea.\nHe said there is no scientific consensus on what is the safe age to start using cannabis. The answer, he said, is when someone is mature enough to do so.\nIf 18 is old enough to vote or drink, it should be old enough to make a decision to consume cannabis, he said.\nRaising the age to 21 would create an inconsistency and criminalize something 18- to 20-year-olds would have been doing legally up until the change is made, he said.\nHospital and social services institutions.\nThe CAQ wants to change the provincial cannabis law, enacted in June, to ban smoking the drug in all public places.\nSeveral towns and cities have already announced such a ban, including, most recently, Quebec City.\nThe City of Hampstead banned smoking on municipal property, while Montreal's Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough banned smoking in parks in May and the Saint-Laurent borough has started the process to prevent cannabis from being used in public places in time for Oct. 17.\nBoth those boroughs are controlled by members of Ensemble Montr\u00e9al, the official opposition at city hall. The opposition says the Plante administration is dragging its heels on the subject and should follow Ensemble Montr\u00e9al's lead.\nA spokesperson for the administration says the city's plans on how the drug is to be regulated will be unveiled next week.\nLafreni\u00e8re explained that the provincial law won't trump a municipal bylaw, and so if Montreal doesn't want to implement the same ban, it doesn't have to.\nThe CAQ, he said, is trying to create a framework within which the municipalities can work.\n\"Not even as an ex-police officer, but as a parent, it's always easier to make the rule extremely strict and loosen up later on.\"\nDr. Judith Archambault, who speaks for the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie public health department, said 42 per cent of Quebec consumers of cannabis are between the ages of 18 and 24.\nRaising the legal age to 21 means anyone under that age won't have access to the legal market, so they will resort to the black market.\nThe director of public health in the Quebec City region issued a news release last week, saying the current provincial law goes far enough, and that it is \"unnecessary\" for municipalities implement rules that further ban where cannabis can be smoked.\nIt says, among other things, that forcing pot smokers indoors will make the effects of secondhand smoke worse, and that it creates social equity issues because young people are more likely to be renters and therefore subject to rules that would ban them from smoking at home.\nLandlords in Quebec have taken steps to ensure smoking pot will be banned in rental properties.",

Water tankers were set up in three different areas of the village.\n\u201cFull restoration is not known at this time,\u201d Gene Guerrero, trouble dispatcher supervisor, said in an email statement Monday morning.\nWhen asked for more information about the specific nature of the problem, Waterworks spokeswoman Heidi Ballendorf on Monday morning declined to comment on the phone, aside from the statement released by GWA, and asked the newspaper to submit its questions to her in writing.\nAlthough Ballendorf would not say exactly what was wrong with the water system, she said parts have been ordered and are on their way.\nYigo Mayor Rudy Matanane on Monday said the water outage is due to a burnt motor, and that the water agency has no replacement parts on island.\n\u201cGWA wasn\u2019t just born yesterday, and all these procurement issues should have been solved two decades ago. It\u2019s bad enough to not have water for even a half hour, especially for those families that have babies or small children who depend on it for feeding. By now this should be like clock-work, where when something breaks it can be fixed right away,\u201d he said.\nFor northern residents of Yigo and surrounding areas this news is nothing new. Melinda White, 34, explained how the water shortage had already affected her family.\n\u201cLast Monday (October 16) we started experiencing low water pressure which initially was not a huge deal because we could still shower and wash, it just took us a little longer.\u201d As of Wednesday, however, White said her water was completely out, but a friend offered to have her family over and make use of a guest bathroom, Thursday and Friday.\nOn Saturday, White\u2019s husband returned from a week-long Air Force training in Japan and wanted to enjoy some family time at home to catch up. White realized that she would have to book a hotel for a weekend to greet her husband and avoid another day of shower-runs to her friend\u2019s home with her family.\nWhite estimated that staying in a hotel and dining out over the weekend cost about $400.\nMatanane said that, in a meeting with GWA acting general manager Paul Kemp, he suggested that GWA work with military leadership to borrow a motor from its inventory for the time being until the one that has been ordered arrives.\nSince her move to Guam in January from Arizona, White said she had never experienced a water outage. As of Sunday morning, her home\u2019s water had been restored, although the pressure is not fully back to normal, she said.\n\u201cI wish affected residents had at least gotten a message with a heads-up of what the issue is. I understand phone calls take time ,but we know they have our e-mails because that is how we receive our monthly statements. I even questioned whether it was only our house whose water was shut off, and asked myself if I had paid the GWA for September,\u201d she said.",

Jet Airways promised me $1,360 under EC 261, the European airline consumer protection regulation.\nI sent Jet Airways an EC 261 claim. Within three days, the airline responded, and it agreed to pay 600 euros to my wife and me. Jet Airways requested copies of our passports, the boarding passes, and our signatures on a release and discharge letter. I sent everything they were requesting that same day, but have not heard back from them since.\nIt\u2019s been more than a week since I sent the forms. Should I be worried?\nA. You should not be worried. Processing a claim under EC 261 takes time \u2014 weeks, months, and in some rare cases, even years. But one thing you should worry about a little is whether you had a valid claim. In recent weeks, I\u2019ve seen an uptick of cases involving an airline promising a refund under EC 261 but then not delivering.\nWhat\u2019s EC 261? It\u2019s the European airline consumer protection rule that says if an airline delays your flight, it will compensate you. There are important exceptions. For example, some flights and some situations, like air traffic control delays, aren\u2019t covered. But typically, when an airline agrees to pay your claim, it\u2019s a done deal.\nI told you to wait \u2014 and you did. A month passed. Nothing. Another month. Still nothing. You contacted me again, asking about your EC 261 claim, and that\u2019s when I became worried. I recommended that you reach out to someone at Jet Airways about your claim. I list the names, numbers, and e-mail addresses for the customer service executives at Jet Airways on my nonprofit consumer-advocacy site. Finally, I became so concerned that I also reached out to Jet Airways on your behalf. Although EC 261 doesn\u2019t require an airline to process a claim within a certain amount of time, two months really seems to be pushing it.\nJet Airways paid you $1,360, the full value of your claim.\nChristopher Elliott can be reached at chris@elliott.org.",

And he got some timely assistance from his defense.\nVorobyev, centering a line of Simmonds and James van Riemsdyk, looked right at home on a night when the building was rocking as the Knights raised their Western Conference championship banner from last season.\nVorobyev, who switched to No. 24 at the end of training camp, calmed down after a rather tense first few minutes.\nCoach Dave Hakstol was encouraged by what he saw, especially his reaction to the Holden-Patrick dust-up.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the make-up of our team and the nature of our team,\u2019\u2019 he began. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play hard for one another and battle hard for one another.\nAs for the Flyers\u2019 spotless penalty kill, this looked a lot different than last year\u2019s 29th-ranked mess. At least for one night.\n\u201c[The PK] is big,\u2019\u2019 Laughton said. \u201cTo provide energy for your team and momentum changes. That\u2019s huge, to kill off a big penalty.

They got lots of love from the Barfield family, who own the produce business along with a country store in Alford.\nThe hurricane caused major damage to both businesses, half-demolishing the store in Cottondale. Clint Barfield, who got the tortoises five years ago, decided to move them to his 500-acre farm for safety and keep them in a makeshift pen.\nA couple of weeks later, while Barfield and his wife Rhonda were out, Brooks managed to squeeze past a loose board in the pen and get away.

That is because invasive sampling techniques, such as collecting blood or using oral swabs, require anesthesia in the field.\nUC Davis graduate student researcher Tierra Smiley Evans and the PREDICT team have now developed a noninvasive method to simplify the sampling of primates in challenging, remote locations. The method is described in a study published in June in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.\nSimple and affordable, the method opens new doors for the study of primates as sources of diseases that could affect humans in remote tropical settings.\n\u201cThis method is already being deployed in multiple countries throughout the world as part of the PREDICT project and is expanding our ability to investigate primate populations that we were previously unable to sample,\u201d said UC Davis professor Christine Kreuder Johnson, surveillance lead for the PREDICT project and senior author on the study.\nA six-inch piece of weaved rope made from nylon or cotton is dipped into an attractant such as strawberry jam. The ropes are tossed near the animals being targeted for sampling, which pick up the ropes, chew on them and drop them.\nResearchers can then collect saliva from the discarded ropes.\nThe sample is taken to a lab, where teams test it for viral diseases that may pose a direct threat to humans.\nIn this study, oral samples were collected from multiple species, including rhesus macaques in Nepal and olive baboons, red-tailed guenons and L\u2019hoest\u2019s monkeys in Uganda. A variety of viruses, including herpesviruses and simian foamy viruses, were detected in those samples.\nWild primates are prime candidates for passing diseases to humans because they are closely related to us genetically and, in many parts of the world, regularly come into contact with people.\nFor example, at sacred temples in Kathmandu, Nepal, rhesus macaques roam the temple grounds and exist among the tourists and locals who pass through the temple. Food and other items can often exchange hands. And in the remote town of Buhoma in Uganda, red-tailed guenons come down from the trees to investigate people and look for food.\nThese kinds of human-animal interfaces need monitoring most, the researchers said, because they lend themselves to the spillover of pathogens that can cause a pandemic.\nViruses that originate in wild animals account for more than 70 percent of emerging zoonotic diseases in humans, including viruses that have caused pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, epidemics such as Ebola and smaller outbreaks like Marburg hemorrhagic fever.\nThe study was funded by the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats Program and a William J. Fulbright Fellowship provided to Smiley Evans.\nDownload photos and read the study.",

    "text": "Cheese balls and chestnuts - With 13 of 34 bowls in the books, more than a third of the postseason is behind us, most of it of the superfluous appetizer variety. Those who skipped the first third of bowl season haven\u2019t missed much.\nIn summary, the Mountain West Conference is 3-0 following victories by Wyoming (over Fresno State in the New Mexico Bowl), BYU (over Oregon State in the Las Vegas Bowl) and Utah (over Cal in the Poinsettia Bowl), increasing BCS-status clamor for the Mountain West and providing more ammunition for those who claim TCU (12-0) is more deserving of a title shot at the Crimson Tide than Texas.\nIn terms of individual performances, Middle Tennessee\u2019s Dwight Dasher set a bowl record for quarterbacks by rushing for 201 yards in a 42-32 victory over Southern Miss in the New Orleans Bowl. Still, Dasher\u2019s performance probably hasn\u2019t supplanted Vince Young\u2019s 200-yard opus in the 2006 Rose Bowl in a single fan\u2019s mind.\nFruitcake - The Sugar Bowl officially is the season\u2019s most bizarre bowl. God told Urban Meyer to retire the day after Christmas but then returned to Urban on the 27th and downgraded His suggestion to a sabbatical. All that kissing with Tim Tebow should have been a sign that Meyer was an odd bird, but this latest flip-flop deal is the capper. Meyer is the biggest sports flake since George Foreman, and he hasn\u2019t been repeatedly battered about the head.\nIncredibly, Florida has a saner sideline than its Sugar Bowl opponent: Unbeaten Cincinnati will play down one head coach (Brian Kelly to Notre Dame) and depending on an interim guy (Jeff Quinn) who will take over at Buffalo after leaving New Orleans. Meanwhile, future Bearcats coach Butch Jones will be watching on TV.\nFried squirrel and Budweiser - The Chick-fil-A Bowl features Tennessee and Virginia Tech, two teams who seriously considered playing a game at Bristol Motor Speedway before officials reconfigured the track. Who\u2019s head hillbilly?\nFiggy pudding - Apparently it was a 19th-century thing, sort of like Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who will be coaching his last game against West Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Jan. 1. In related news, Paterno State faces LSU at the same time on the same day in the same state in the Capital One Bowl.\nSweet potatoes - Yeah, they\u2019re on the table, but has anyone actually ever eaten them? Undefeated Fiesta Bowl competitors TCU and Boise State spent the entire season on the periphery of the BCS title-game discussion and didn\u2019t even get a shot at a BCS conference team for their flawless efforts.\nDressing - In some houses, desire to dig into the stuffing trumps the turkey every time. If there was only one bowl game to watch this season, it might be the Rose Bowl featuring Ohio State and Oregon, a pair of 10-2 teams with intriguingly gifted quarterbacks.\nCanned cranberry sauce - Our weak-sauce award thus far goes to Clemson, which had the audacity to chant \u201cA-C-C, A-C-C\u201d after beating Kentucky in the Music City Bowl. C.J. Spiller was his usual, game-shaping self, rolling up 172 all-purpose yards. But the rest of the Tigers need to be reminded that the ACC runners-up probably shouldn\u2019t crow about conference superiority after edging the fifth-place team from the SEC East.\nYule log - In the bowl game most closely resembling a leper, Marshall is rumored to have beaten Ohio in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl, the Detroit-hosted MAC nightmare formerly known as the Motor City Bowl. You know you\u2019re in trouble when Frank Solich is easily the most recognizable person in attendance.",

    "text": "Most ski and snowboard instructors do a lot more than teach.\nSometimes they teach beginners, and sometimes they guide more advanced athletes who just want a fun day on the hill. They share their knowledge about preventing injury, activities in the valley and competition and often form relationships with clients that last for years.\nNow, a group of local pros is trying to apply that teaching model throughout the year. Pros in Motion, a business based in the Roaring Fork Valley, contracts ski and snowboard pros to give clients that all-around experience while they\u2019re recreating in other sports, particularly cycling.\nPros in Motion works with everyone from kids and older athletes just learning how to ride a bike to more advanced cyclists who want to explore the valley.\nPros in Motion was created almost by accident when Kasin started riding with his ski clients. Kasin was racing bikes at the highest level for amateurs when he had a heart attack at age 41. After recovering, Kasin was still training, albeit not at the same level.\nThat person has become one of Kasin\u2019s favorite ski clients, he said.\nKasin has since formalized the program, booking clients with pros who match their skill sets and availability. Pros in Motion operates independently, but it partners with the Viceroy in Snowmass Village and The Little Nell and the Limelight in Aspen, running cycling adventures out of the hotels.\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve gotten to the point where we\u2019re training our pros, we\u2019re choosing our pros based on a common set of goals and a way of approaching the guest and treating the guest,\u201d Kasin said.\nDaRosa rode with a family from New York City that was in town right before the start of the USA Pro Challenge. DaRosa started off with the father, taking him over some of the race route, and then he asked DaRosa to take his family out for an afternoon.\nThe clients were flying back before the race actually kicked off, but they joined DaRosa for the opening ceremonies on Aug. 17 in Snowmass Base Village.\nHealth and safety are also important facets to what the pros do, including nutrition and hydration tips as well as sharing Kasin\u2019s knowledge of cardiac health. All the pros are CPR and AED certified, and some have had some first-responder or mountain-rescue training.\nKasin wants to give locals and others who haven\u2019t ridden with the group yet a chance to participate with a four-day event later this month. One day each will be dedicated to leading people over the Pro Challenge Stage 1 route and up and down Independence Pass. The pros will lead groups on a tour of the Roaring Fork Valley another day and a double stage of the Maroon Bells and Castle Creek Road on the last day.\nKasin is planning the tour for the weekend of Sept. 22 and 23. He said athletes can participate in two or more days, stretched out over two different weekends or four days in a row. Groups will be broken out by skill level.\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a different dimension to riding in the fall versus the summer, and we want to share that with everyone,\u201d Kasin said.\nTheir work doesn\u2019t stop there. The pros are continuing to help people train for events throughout the fall, including the Rally the Valley race on Sept. 21 in Glenwood Springs and El Tour de Tucson on Nov. 23. The pros also help people train for ski season.",

    "text": "Many more beacons will be felt, even if not necessarily seen.\nBeacons have been installed in many stores of many retailers, at least initially as trials of one sort or another.\nThe little radio-transmitting, battery-powered devices have been sold by the thousands and many have been deployed at store entrances and in various departments.\nBut the idea of having to replace batteries in thousands of beacons somewhere down the road has hardly been an appealing idea to anyone involved in store operations.\nIn addition to retail, beacons are in 93% of Major League Baseball stadiums, 75% of National Football League stadiums, 53% of National Basketball Association arenas and 47% of National Hockey League arenas, according to Unacast.\nBut beacons at retail provide a relative sweet spot for mobile commerce.\nFor example, beacons are installed at more than 100 stores (Burberry, Hugo Boss, Godiva, etc.) on Regent Street in London. Those beacons are tuned to pedestrian traffic so passersby receive mobile messages when they\u2019re in the right place.\nAnd the beacons drive results.\nAlmost half (48%) of those with the Regent Street app use it more than twice a month, according to Henry Lawson, CEO of AutoGraph, the company that deployed and runs the Regent Street beaconing program for the association.\nRegent Street stores are getting a 10-times uplift in offer redemption from beaconing and 63% are using the app to plan visits to restaurants, according to Lawson.\nBut over time, the actual standalone beacon is becoming embedded in other things, from Wi-Fi access points in large stores to lighting.\nAs a result, the location data from beaconing is becoming more integrated with other location data, such as from GPS signals and Wi-Fi.\nAs yet another example of beacons integrating with other aspects of commerce, the platform of Boston-based Swirl just became integrated with Oracle so that personalized marketing, via beacons, can occur in a more integrated fashion.\nThe idea is that in-store shopper behavioral data can be used to target and deliver personalized content with Oracle Marketing Cloud.\nThe Swirl platform leverages digital location signals from beacons, GPS and Wi-Fi to generate first-party data for different marketing channels.\nThe initial thought for many installing beacons was that in-store shoppers could be sent messages as they neared certain products.\nThe reality is that beacons can do so much more.\nSince they awaken specific mobile apps on a phone, they can be used to gather customer feedback via surveys after a customer leaves a store. They also can be used for retargeting shoppers later with personalized emails or online ads, as well as being able to check the effectiveness of paid media in driving store traffic.\nIn addition to being the place where most shoppers buy the most, physical stores now become a key asset in cross-channel marketing. And the beaconing helps. A lot.",

    "text": "For all the action, mistakes, easter eggs and cameos in blockbuster movies, the drama and comedy behind the scenes can be just as awesome. We're changing things up, and giving you a rapid fire dose of movie trivia you never thought to look for. Screen Rant presents: Know Your Movies: 20 Amazing Movie Secrets That Will Blow Your Mind.\nThe product placement in the Jurassic Park sequel/reboot stuck out like a sore thumb, with Samsung, Verizon, Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's and even Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville featured prominently. But it wasn't the studio's work. The director actually requested the sponsors, claiming that if the park were opened today, every part of it would be branded.\nThe final battle of the second Avengers movie is set in the fictional Sokovia, but it was filmed at a London police training college. The statue in the town square was given a fake beard for the movie (to resemble an Eastern European figure?) - a necessary move for British audiences, since the statue is a well-known monument to Robert Peel, the inventor of the modern police force, and the reason British cops are still called \"bobbies\" to this day.\nThe director of Furious Seven, James Wan confused everyone when he explained that the \"seven\" in the movie's title was meant to be the actual word, not the number of the movie's place in the series. Why? Apparently the movie's title is actually a tribute to the classic Japanese movie Seven Samurai, with Wan seeing Dominic Toretto and his team of racers as Hollywood's modern - horsepowered - Samurai.\nThe secret NASA mission to save a stranded astronaut in The Martian is given the title \"Project Elrond,\" a reference to a secret meeting in The Lord of the Rings' first chapter, Fellowship of The Ring. When Ridley Scott realized Sean Bean was actually in that exact scene in the movie version of the story, and would also explain the name in this film, he wanted to change the project's title. But the crew demanded it stay, since the joke was actually a hilarious coincidence.\nTom Cruise is famous for doing his own massive stunts, from climbing skyscrapers to hanging onto an airplane as it takes off. But the actor's training even covers the stunt driving in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. It wasn't to meet the star's demands, either: the stunt coordinator claimed he didn't have a stunt driver who was better than Cruise.\nAny superhero actor has to hit the gym before shooting their scenes, but apparently, Paul Rudd was more committed to getting into shape than Marvel expected. When they started shooting, the Ant-Man costume had to be altered to compensate for Rudd's added muscle and lost fat. And an unscripted shirtless scene was added shortly after.\nBack in 1983, Mark Hamill gave an interview to TV AM in the UK, and told reporters that George Lucas spoke of bringing Luke Skywalker back as an Obi-Wan-type character training a new generation of Jedi in a potential Star Wars sequel, Episode 7. He also said Episode 7 wouldn't happen until 2011. Freaky.\nThe villain of Fury Road is larger than life in every way - except for the weapon he seems to be praying to. That's an authentic Australian waddy, a weapon used as recently as World War I. When the actor's mother-in-law left it to him, he asked the director to work it into the movie, and the rest is history.\nMarvel may be churning out blockbusters, but they don't spend money if they don't have to. The massive set constructed for the Kyln prison in Guardians of the Galaxy was so expensive to build, the studio only agreed to foot the bill after planning to melt down all the steel after filming, and sell it back to the supplier.\nEven though most fans will miss it, Ewan McGregor and Frank Oz were both brought back to record new dialogue as Obi-Wan and Yoda. But the audio team went to even greater lengths, editing Alec Guinness' recordings from the original Star Wars trilogy to pull characters' names out of other words he spoke, giving both Obi-Wan's a spot in the film.\nThe Nick Fury chase scene through city streets was a hit with The Winter Soldier audiences because it actually seemed realistic - but they didn't know just how realistic it was. The sequence was based on a 2010 Brazilian police chase that looks almost exactly the same (minus the flipping cars), and the directors even played the police video as part of their original pitch to Marvel.\nA major highlight of The LEGO Movie is Liam Neeson's role as both Good Cop and Bad Cop. The directors wanted to record them separately, but Neeson thought it would be better to rapidly switch from one to the other. The result was a crazed, manic split-personality filled with improvisation - and fans loved every second.\nThe movie that rebooted the X-Men movie universe had it all: new mutants, returning favorites... even a romance between Wolverine and Storm. The future scene was deleted, but it showed the movie versions of the heroes finally gave in to their attraction like they had multiple times in the comics. Maybe the second time is the charm.\nThe original ending of Dawn saw the apes watching as battleships approached in San Francisco Bay, promising an imminent war. Director Matt Reeves decided to go with a more emotional ending between the movie's ape and human leads. It's a incredible ending scene, even though it was filmed weeks before release, Reeves directing via Skype, and a stand-in for Andy Serkis' actually on set.\nIt may have killed Sony's solo Spider-Man series, but the original ending would have had fans talking for years. Peter's father Richard Parker coming back from the dead is one thing, but showing Venom in OsCorp's basement - along with the frozen head of Norman Osborn - leaves every fan with unanswered questions of what would have come next.\nIn all the suspense and twists and turns of this story, audiences probably missed some time-consuming CG effects. According to director David Fincher, with the number and variety of wigs that star Rosamund Pike had to wear, there isn't a single shot of her in the movie that didn't require a special effects team to retouch her hairline. Who knew to even look?\nWhen Henry Civil showed up for his Superman screen test, the prototype Man of Steel costume wasn't available - so they used the classic Christopher Reeve version instead. When Cavill stepped out of wardrobe in the brightly coloured, outdated suit with bright red underwear, and everyone on set grew quiet, he knew he had found the man for the job.\nThe sprawling corn field used in just a few scenes of Interstellar required 500 acres to be planted and grown. It might sound like insanity on Christopher Nolan's part, but when shooting wrapped, the corn was sold - for a hefty profit.\nMost fans know the Disney hit Frozen is based on \"The Snow Queen\" by Hans Christian Andersen. But the main characters' names are no coincidence. Say them out loud fast enough, and \"Hans, Kristoff, Anna, Sven\" is clearly a play on the author's name that few will catch on their own.\nDirector Steven Spielberg had young actresses record blood-curdling screams to see how they'd handle the movie's terrifying twists. When he played actress Ariana Richards' tape, and it was the only recorded Scream to raise his wife from bed in a panic, he realized he had found his Lex.\nThose are some of our favorite mind blowing movie facts, but let us know which ones we missed and stay tuned for more!

    "text": "L.A. schools chief Austin Beutner, left, confers with school board member Monica Garcia.\nA proposal to forestall the Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s looming fiscal problems by asking voters to approve a new parcel tax failed to win enough support Tuesday to make it onto the November ballot.\nMoney from the parcel tax would have gone toward filling the multi-million dollar shortfall the district expects to have in four years, when it has spent down its reserves.\nBut in a spirited discussion Tuesday, the board split 3 to 3 over the question of whether there was enough time to persuade two-thirds of voters to support the tax.\n\u201cPeople are gone for the summer, the board doesn\u2019t reconvene until mid-August. \u2026 It just seems like too ad hoc of a strategy,\u201d said Nick Melvoin, one of three board members who voiced support for postponing the measure to 2020, when a presidential election will probably increase voter turnout.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a willingness from board members to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to spend the next three months knocking on doors,\u2019\u201d Melvoin said.\nHe was joined by Ref Rodriguez and Monica Garcia, who was elected by her colleagues Tuesday to another term as board president. Board member Kelly Gonez, who gave birth to a boy last weekend, was absent for the vote. The four make up a bloc of charter school allies who effectively control the seven-member board.\nThe pro-parcel tax group led by board member George McKenna was seeking approval for a flat tax on individual properties, with exemptions for people 65 and older and those with very little income. The size of the tax was up for debate, provided that it was high enough to significantly reduce the district\u2019s projected deficit. Board members Richard Vladovic and Scott Schmerelson also supported the measure.\nSupporters of the November timeline said that waiting two years to put the measure before voters could force board members into a politically risky situation. Several of them are expected to be running for reelection in 2020 at the same time that they might be asking voters to raise taxes.\nCharter school advocates, several of whom spoke at the board meeting, said they would not support a ballot measure that increased funding only for L.A. Unified but not for the more-than 200 charter schools within its boundaries.\nSupt. Austin Beutner said he opposed the November timeline. Putting the measure on the ballot this fall and campaigning to raise public awareness would cost L.A. Unified about $5 million, he said, and probably would not succeed. \u201cI believe a better option is to properly plan to do this for 2020 when we can be successful,\u201d he said.\nTo increase the chances of a win, L.A. Unified could take a page from the San Francisco schools\u2019 playbook and collect voter signatures to get the measure on the ballot. This would lower the threshold needed to pass the tax from a two-thirds majority to a simple majority.\nIn a sign of how far the school board has shifted politically since last summer\u2019s elections, it voted 4 to 2 on Tuesday to hire the law firm of Latham & Watkins to advise the district as it attempts a financial restructuring.\nThe vote was unusual because the firm had not previously been viewed as an ally. It has sued L.A. Unified four times in the last several years, according to district officials. In at least one of those cases, the firm sued the district on behalf of charter school advocates.\nOf the four board members who voted to work with the firm, the majority of them were elected with wide support from wealthy charter advocates.\nAccording to district officials, Latham & Watkins offered its legal services for free. L.A. Unified has agreed to pay its expenses.\n4:45 p.m.: This article was updated with additional details about the parcel tax vote and Tuesday\u2019s board meeting.",

The global Brent crude contract for July was down $1, or 1.6%, at $63.64 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.\n\"The fact remains that supply is continuing to outstrip demand,\" analyst Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute said in a note. \"It is very difficult to see how the massive oversupply situation is going to reverse in the short to medium term.\"\nGlobally, analysts said Saudi Arabia was talking of increasing production and Libya could also soon raise output, while Iraq is pumping at near-record levels, contributing to swelling supplies. Talks to resolve a diplomatic stalemate with Iran were continuing, leading up to a June 30 deadline, with the potential to eventually release at least another 500,000 barrels a day onto world markets. Analysts say global supplies continue to mount at a rate of around 2 million barrels a day.\nIn the U.S., a closely watched but loose gauge of production, the number of rigs deployed to drill for oil, fell for the 27th consecutive week and is now 60% below year-ago levels. But the U.S. Energy Information Administration&apos;s estimate of production continues to rise, edging up 24,000 barrels last week to 9.6 million barrels a day---nearly 14% higher than a year ago and the highest level in more than four decades.\nOil benchmarks have rallied off their lows set in late March, but the recovery has lost steam, with prices trading in a narrow range around $60 a barrel since early May. Prices are up nearly 40% from their low set earlier this year but a far cry from the $100-a-barrel range that dominated for the past several years. Though financial investors remain positioned for a rising market overall, regulatory data shows they edged back from bullish positions in both contracts by 3% or more last week.\nMeanwhile, the dollar strengthened as concerns about Greek solvency carried on. A stronger dollar can weigh on oil as it becomes more expensive for traders using non-U.S. currency.\n\"Although several bearish items appear to be at work in prompting selling, we are prioritizing a strengthening dollar as the main negative influence,\" research consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates said in a note.\nIn refined products, gasoline futures were down 1% at $2.10 a gallon on the Nymex and diesel futures were down 1.5% at $1.86 a gallon.",

    "text": "It seems a straightforward offer: swap your resident\u2019s parking permit for a bit of greenery in the freed-up space, a lawn, a sun terrace or somewhere for the children to play. However, if any further proof was needed of the west\u2019s destructive love affair with the car, the furious reaction to a pilot project in one of the Netherlands\u2019 biggest cities has been all too telling.\nThe drama was sparked by the Dutch municipality\u2019s proposal to residents in six streets in Segbroek, a suburb in the west of the city, to voluntarily swap their parking permit for six months and replace it with something green and pleasant on their street.\nTheir vehicles would be stored in a car park for free, and those participating could choose between themselves how to use the vacant space.\nThe long-term aim, beyond greening the city, is to encourage people to use car-sharing schemes, if they really need a vehicle, or switch to public transport and bicycles. Globally, most cars are said to be parked 95% of the time.\nDresscher, an architect by training, said opposition from many residents in the selected areas illustrated how deeply people were attached to their cars, even in the Netherlands, which is often a pioneer in terms of green transportation. The idea of a parking space being lost from a street was too much for some to bear.\n\u201cI was a bit like a boxing guy, I took everything,\u201d he said of the public meeting attended by 200 residents. \u201cIf I was to respond, like I would in a personal conversation, the meeting would not have finished very well ... Everybody took \u2013 and this in the Netherlands is more rare than in other countries \u2013 very opposite positions. Normally, we are a country where we have a dialogue, we talk to each other.\n\u201cThe idea was to get people together but it didn\u2019t. Why? If there is one that is very angry and starts mobilising the whole street then you have a problem.\nDresscher insisted the initial hostility has abated but, as yet, only six householders have signed up to the scheme, with their cars due to be removed in June. Two residents have, however, pre-empted the scheme by putting flower-filled tow-carts in front of their homes, much to the irritation of some. Drivers have been known to shout abuse as they drive by.\nDresscher, who has \u20ac60,000 of funding from the council and charities, is still confident that more people will come round to his thinking, and is glad that a debate has been started.\nRembrant Frerichs, 40, and, Wolfert Brederode, 44, both pianists, and neighbours on Newtonstreet, said they believed it was an important first step in changing the nature of their road, but were yet to decide how to use the space in front of their homes.\nBrederode said: \u201cI just don\u2019t think I need the car outside my house all the time and I\u2019m going to see if we need it at all. I don\u2019t think there is any reason.\nDresscher said the project had been inspired by the experience of being forced to push his baby\u2019s pram on the road when living in Amsterdam because cars were blocking the pavement.\nDresscher\u2019s response from the Amsterdam municipality suggested that 25% of those cars used by residents were only driven once a week on average. Around 60% used their cars less due to fears that they would lose their parking place.\nA spokesman for The Hague municipality said: \u201cPeople get the opportunity to choose themselves what they want to do with the public space. They can park their cars in the street or start sharing cars and fill up the free parking spots for other purposes like green, bicycle parking or picnic tables.",

    "text": "After seven seasons together with the Cubs, could the Theo Trio be on the verge of a breakup?\nThat could depend on the Giants. Or the Mets.\nBoth are looking for new general managers, and Jason McLeod, the Cubs\u2019 top scouting and player-development executive, already has been linked to both. The Giants job opened Monday with Bobby Evans\u2019 firing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not actively looking because of how great things are here,\u201d said McLeod, who sat alongside team president Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer during the fall 2011 news conference introducing them as the Cubs\u2019 new front-office regime.\nMcLeod (foreground) with Epstein and Hoyer during their introductory press conference in the fall of 2011.\nCould that time be now?\nMcLeod interviewed for the Twins\u2019 GM job in 2016. He was asked to interview with the Padres in 2014 but withdrew his name, citing unfinished business with the Cubs.\nNeither the Giants nor the Mets are far enough into their processes to have sought permission from the Cubs to interview McLeod.\nThe Giants could be a fit for McLeod, a former minor-league pitcher with a new-school front-office background.\nMcLeod, who grew up in San Diego, worked with Giants manager Bruce Bochy when both were with the Padres, Bochy managing and McLeod working as a minor-league coach and in the scouting and player-development department.\nMcLeod has been a trendy name to include in rumors about GM openings from the first few years of the Cubs\u2019 rebuild effort.\nHe said the last few years have made him even better equipped to take on the role of a baseball-operations boss.\nAs MLB\u2019s investigation into the domestic-violence accusations against Addison Russell continues, manager Joe Maddon has made a conspicuous point to stay as far removed from details of the situation as possible.\nHe and other officials in the organization said they have heard no update from the league office on its investigation since Russell was put on administrative leave Friday.\nRussell is not expected to return to the team.",

    "text": "Keeping cyber thieves at bay is hard. They are busy, well-motivated and well-financed.\nJust one example serves to show just how prolific they are. Every day, come rain or shine, they crank out about 250,000 novel variants of viruses.\nTheir vigour has helped them steal data from some really big companies, Target, Home Depot and eBay, in the last few months.\nAnd, what is a problem for the big companies is even more acute for the smaller firms. They have an even tougher time keeping the bad guys out.\n\"They are exposed to many of the same attacks as much larger enterprises, yet they don't have the security expertise and resources available to those larger firms,\" said Maxim Weinstein, a security advisor at security firm Sophos.\nWhile attacks on the eBays and Sonys of the world make the headlines there's no doubt that smaller firms are getting hit. And getting hit hard.\nFigures from Sophos suggest about 30,000 websites a day are being compromised by cyber bad guys - most of those will be the public face of one SME or others.\nBecoming a victim of a hack or breach costs smaller firms between \u00a365,000 and \u00a3115,000, according to the PWC survey of the worst data breaches among small firms. Those worst hit will suffer up to six breaches a year, PWC suggested, so the total cost could be even higher.\nFor a smaller firm finding that much cash to clean up after a breach could mean the difference between keeping trading and going bust.\nThis lack of focus on cyber security is understandable, said Mr Weinstein, as most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) spent most of their time on core commercial activity such as keeping customers happy, seeking out new clients and engaging in all the basic day-to-day admin needed to keep their enterprise afloat.\nWorrying about computer security comes a long down their To Do lists, he said.\nBut they do need to worry because the nature of commerce in the 21st century means that there are relatively few SMEs that do not make heavy use of technology, said Steven Harrison, lead technologist at IT services firm Exponential-e.\n\"You do see a knowledge gap,\" he said \"in that you have these smaller companies that are smaller in terms of people and revenue but they are not smaller in terms of the IT they use.\"\nEcommerce, websites, apps, smartphones, tablets, social media and cloud services were all now standard ways of doing business in the 21st century, he said.\nAnd, he added, there were some SMEs that were based entirely around technology but that did not make them experts in how to keep their digital business secure.\n\"There are some businesses that are much more than just users of technology,\" he said. \"They have huge computing requirements as well as massive storage and bandwidth requirements - far more than their head count would suggest.\"\nEither way, he said, everyone is a target and they all need to look externally to security firms for help.\n\"In the same way they don't run your own bank or accountancy firm they shouldn't run their own security operation,\" he said adding that SMEs often need help to understand the sheer range of threats arrayed against them.\nEveryone is familiar with attempts to penetrate internal networks to steal payment information or customer data records but may be less knowledgeable about invoice fraud, ransomware, malvertising, or even attacks that \"scrape\" websites with automated tools to steal all the information about prices and products they contain.\nAnd that was where they hit their first problem, he said. How much do they spend? Estimates vary on how much SMEs spend on IT security.\nThe most recent government figures published 18 months ago suggest SMEs with 100 or more employees spend about \u00a310,000 per year. The smallest small firms, with less than 20 staff, spend about \u00a3200. Other estimates put the spend at about \u00a330 per employee.\nMr Weinstein from Sophos said SMEs should start with the basics.\nThis includes anti-virus software, firewalls, spam filters on email gateways and keeping devices up to date. This, he said, would defeat the majority of the low level threats that those busy cyber thieves are churning out.\nGovernment advice on how SMEs can be safer revolves around a 10 steps programme that emphasises basic, good practice. It's big on those simple steps such as keeping software up to date and applying the widely used software tools that can spot and stop the most prolific threats.\nBut it also stresses that smaller firms understand more about how they use data and how it flows around their organisation.\nThis is important, said Greg Hanson from services firm Informatica, because security is no longer about setting up a fortress around your systems, servers and staff to keep the bad guys out. Now, he said, the way data flows between SMEs, their supply chains and customers has made it impossible to maintain the fortress-like security stance.\nHaving a good sense of where data goes and who uses it can help limit the damage if it goes astray, he said.\n\"There's a proliferation of data flowing through organisations that really needs to be controlled better,\" he said.\nHaving control of that data, knowing its value and where it is going, can help a company guard against it leaking out accidentally and maliciously. For instance, having that control might help a firm spot that a server was accidentally exposed to the net and private information was viewable by anyone.\nIt can also help SMEs keep an eye on their suppliers and partners to ensure that data is handled appropriately.\nAnd finally, said Mr Harrison from Exponential-e, firms need to put in place a plan for what happens when a breach or security incident does occur.\n\"It's not a question of if something bad will happen,\" he said. \"It will, but it's all about what they do about it.\"",

    "text": "Satellite image of Hurricane Lee taken earlier today.\nTROPICAL STORM LEE formed in the waters off Louisiana today, threatening a drenching along much of the Gulf coast over the weekend with up to 20 inches of rain in some spots.\nMississippi\u2019s governor declared a state of emergency in seven counties on or near the coast, saying the storm is expected to cause tremendous flooding. A state of emergency frees up resources that can be used to prepare for a storm, and Louisiana\u2019s governor declared one yesterday because of the threat of flash flooding. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu also declared a state of emergency for the city today.\nLee could unleash \u201cefficient and torrential topical rains\u201d for the next several days, the US National Weather Service said.\nIn the French Quarter, some tourists were caught off guard by the storm as it rained on and off. Kyla Holley of Madison, Wisconsin and her husband, Rob, were in for the Labour Day weekend holiday.\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from Mississippi to Texas, including New Orleans, and flash flood warnings extended along the Alabama coast into the Florida Panhandle. The National Hurricane Centre said the system will dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over southern areas of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama through Sunday and as much as 20 inches in some spots.\nThe storm also has cut off nearly half the normal oil production from the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s US waters. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement said Friday that 169 of the 617 manned production platforms in the Gulf have been evacuated, along with 16 of the 62 drilling rigs now operating in the Gulf. The evacuations have resulted in the shut-off of 47.6 per cent of the Gulf\u2019s daily normal oil production and 33 per cent of the normal daily natural gas production.\nThe water-logged storm is tantalizingly close to Texas but still too far away to alleviate the state\u2019s worst drought since the 1950s. If the centre moves mostly into Louisiana, as expected, winds on its west side will blow from land to open water and reduce the chance of rain in Texas, NWS meteorologist Dennis Cavanaugh in Fort Worth said. The hot, dry winds could spur fire danger across the state.\nIn Alabama, Gov Robert Bentley didn\u2019t declare an emergency but ordered state agencies to be ready to respond if needed.\nMorning skies were overcast with spotty rain on the Alabama coast Friday morning, but workers were still putting boats in the water for the Labour Day weekend at Sportsman Marina in Orange Beach, Ala.\nLee is the 12th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.\nThe National Hurricane Centre said the centre of Lee was about 320 km southeast of Cameron, Louisiana, on Friday and moving northwest at just 4 kph. Its centre was expected to make landfall in Louisiana over the weekend.\n\u201cWow. This could be a very heavy, prolific rainmaker,\u201d National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Revitte said.\nAs hurricane season is hitting its peak in the Atlantic, storm watchers were monitoring three disturbances. Besides the Gulf depression, Katia was spinning in open waters. It regained hurricane strength Friday after weakening the day before and forecasters said it would continue to grow stronger.\nKatia was about 1,134 km east of the Leeward Islands and moving west-northwest at 22.5 kph with maximum sustained winds Friday of 121 kph, making it a Category 1 hurricane.\nThe hurricane centre said it was too early to tell if Katia will hit the US but that it is expected to pass north of the Caribbean.\nThere was also a slow-moving low pressure system about 724 km south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, that had a 60 per cent chance Friday of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next two days.\nThey all come on the heels of Hurricane Irene, which brought destruction from North Carolina to New England late last month.\nIn Louisiana, Gov Bobby Jindal said he was concerned about the serious threat of flash flooding in his state, leading to his emergency action. After devastating Hurricane Katrina in 2005, nothing is taken for granted.\nCraig Taffaro, president of coastal St Bernard Parish, said some flood gates were being closed along bayous and residents were being warned to brace for heavy rain. Still, in a parish that was nearly wiped out six years ago by Katrina, Taffaro wasn\u2019t expecting a major event.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like the public to use this as a drill. Hopefully that\u2019s all it will be,\u201d he said early yesterday afternoon.\nThe Army Corps of Engineers, which operates major flood control structures at New Orleans, was monitoring developments but didn\u2019t plan on closing any flood control structures yet, spokesman Ricky Boyett said in an email.\nEmergency officials along Mississippi\u2019s Gulf Coast expected to get plans in place Friday to deal with the effects from the tropical depression. Jackson County spokesman Ken Flanagan said conference calls were scheduled Friday with Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, along with weather officials.\nAlready, the storm has forced two major petroleum producers to remove crews from a handful of production platforms. Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil said they would also cut off a small amount of production. Both moves affect only a fraction of production.\nLouisiana needs rain \u2014 just not that much, that fast. Both Texas and Louisiana have been suffering through drought. New Orleans, which was least affected by the drought, already was being pelted by sporadic rain. More of a problem is stubborn marsh fire that has blanketed the city with smoke, though the rain will help extinguish it.\nLouisiana\u2019s emergency action allows Jindal to activate the National Guard if necessary and generally makes it easier for parishes and the state to prepare. It also lets parishes ask the state to repay money spent to prepare and fight floods, and lets the state track such expenses, Jindal spokesman Kyle Plotkin said.\n\u201cNow is the time for Louisianians to make sure they have a game plan for themselves and their families should this storm strengthen,\u201d Jindal said in a statement.\nOn Grand Isle, the state\u2019s only inhabited barrier island, people were keeping an eye on the storm that has already brought rain there.\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching it \u2014 we\u2019re watching it closely,\u201d said June Brignac, owner of the Wateredge Beach Resort.\nIt\u2019s not as frightening as having a Category 2 or 3 hurricane bearing down, she said.\nKatrina was the only storm to flood the suites in her motel, which is raised several feet from the ground, in the 20 years she has owned it.\nDespite the weather, officials on Alabama\u2019s Pleasure Island were looking ahead to a busy Labour Day weekend. They expected the holiday weekend to wrap up one of the busiest summers on record as the Alabama Gulf Coast\u2019s economy recovers from last year\u2019s BP oil spill.\nSmall craft warnings were issued from northwest Florida to Texas as seas of at least 1 to 2 feet above normal were in the forecasts. Winds are likely to push tides up to three feet above normal.",

    "text": "New York (TADIAS) \u2013 Emahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru performed at a sold out benefit concert for the first time in 35 years at the Jewish Community Center in Washington, DC last month. The 85-year-old nun and renowned classical pianist and composer captured an eager audience, along with seven young performers who shared the stage with her.\nThe first set at the July 12th event included \u201cThe Song of the Sea\u201d in E-Flat Major and \u201cMother Love\u201d in G major and the previously unpublished \u201cThe Phantoms\u201d \u2014 a set of works evoking early and vivid childhood memories from her early life, growing up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and traveling in Switzerland at the age of six. She played with an unabashed love for melody and thoughtfulness, finishing the set carefully with Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFur Elise,\u201d one of her favorites.\nThe next generation of talented, young performers, ranging in age from eight to 16, played various instruments like the piano, violin, flute and saxophone. Each performer brought the impulses of Girma Yifrashewa, Vivaldi, Schubert and Coltrane.\nThe last set of the program concluded with two unpublished works from Emahoy. Her extraordinary performance was viscerally and emotionally moving. Her astounding ability as a classical pianist and her skill to warmly express \u201cReverie,\u201d was a pleasure to listen to, as was \u201cPresentiment,\u201d a sweet, poetic Sonata in B-Flat Major. She finished the set with a moving \u201cQuo Vadis,\u201d a spiritual reflection that asks where everyone is going.\nAfter a laudatory announcement from the audience, Emahoy returned to the stage to perform \u201cHomeless Wanderer,\u201d a beautifully-phrased piece, with an improvisatory quality that only she can express. The final and her most well known work received a splendid, big over- the-top-rendition from Adam Zerihoun, a 16-year-old from New Jersey with stunning fingerwork.\nThe nostalgic mood of the program signified a torch-passing moment from one generation to another. There was the exceptionally gifted Anasimos Mandefro, a 12-year-old, saxophonist who performed \u201cMr. PC\u201d and \u201cEquinox\u201d by John Coltrane and 16-year-old pianist, Ariel Rose Walzer, who elegantly performed Impromptu No. Allegro in E-Flat by Schubert. Given the right type of support, Emahoy\u2019s compositions have a chance of transcending a new form of classical Ethiopian music.\nThe concert\u2019s proceeds went to The Emahoy Tsege Mariam Music (ETM) Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to teach classical and jazz music to children in Africa and assist American children to study music in Africa. Emahoy\u2019s music can be heard on the Ethiopiques Series, Vol 21.\nMakeda Amha is a great niece of Emahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru.\nI hope she will perform here in Ethiopia as well.\nGod bless her, it\u2019s shows us that there are many talented ethiopian women, she is a role model for every one in ethiopia and abroad.\nit is so funny , to see a monk like this.\nwow! I heard about her but I didn\u2019t know she was real. Seriously she\u2019s an inspiration to all female, young, ethiopian musicians and I\u2019m sure others as well. Hope she lives long enough to make sheet music based on her works for the ALto SaX and Flute and Viola and Piano \u2026..\nFirst of all i want to say for emahoy tsege maraim god bless you for and ever amen.\nyou are anamazing ethiopian treasure ,you inspired alot of young ethiopian people mentally &spritualy ,god bless you emaohy but i have one comment when i\u2019m searching to listen your clssic music from you tube vedio i couldn\u2019t found it please release one of your favaorite song .\nPlease tell me this is recorded and released somewhere on the internet.\nThis magnificent lady should be interviewed on camera to pass her words for future generation.\nI\u2019m glad, blessed and honored to discover you now, \u201cbetter late than never\u201d I wish you long healthy life and thank you for you inspiring spirit and for making me love and appreciate piano even more Kibirt Emahoy!!\nAnd thank you Tadias magazine, you do a great job, God bless!!\nI grew up listening to the \u2018homeless wanderer\u2019 as a soundtrack for many stories back in Ethiopia, the most notable was \u2018Yewodianesh\u2018, a story of forbidden love between a son of an aristocrat and a maid (Yewodianesh).\nI always wondered about Emahoy\u2019s identity all my life. What strikes me is how little is known about this amazing woman (in this bizarre time when people do all kind of stuff to be famous). Thank you Tadias Megazine. Better late than never, as one of the commentors stated. Emahoy, I wish you many many more years!\nhello evrey one ok, artist or emahoy tsege mariam gebru is one of the best we have. do not be surprised of emahoy tsige, we ethiopian are the home of saint yared, the ethiopian style of spritual kebero, masenko and begena bits. what is the big deal. i can sense the way some of you try to dig somthing that i do not like, for example one of you suggusted that people try to do any thing to be famous, i understand your situation as a person , but do not generalize or use commom sense when you contribute your ideas towards people, because it does not motivate us.\nthanks yartistlig love emohoy tsege mariam gebru.\nis it true the reason she became a nun is of a broken heart ?? i love the calmness of her piece.she\u2019s truely spritual.",

    "text": "Warning: This post is a group effort by a few Multichannel News editors who watch Sci Fi Channel\u2019s Battlestar Galactica. The opinions expressed are solely those of the editors; standard spoiler warnings and disclaimers apply.\nMidway through the final season of Battlestar, the ever-present tease to reveal the final Cylon was kicked into overdrive during the preview to this week\u2019s episode.\nThe story so far: We\u2019ve been told since the beginning that there are 12 Cylon models. We\u2019ve known seven models for quite some time. Last season\u2019s stunning finale unveiled that four of the final five were members of the Galactica crew: Saul Tigh, Galen Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders and Tory Foster.\nThat left fans of the show guessing at who the final Cylon could be \u2013 including our own Maria Hernandez, Eric Smith and Tom Umstead, plus me.\nTom thinks it has to be someone really big. Like Lee \u201cApollo\u201d Adama. Actually Admiral William Adama, played by Edward J. Olmos, would be even cooler. But Eric and Maria point out a flaw in that theory. The \u201cLast Supper\u201d photo Sci Fi has used to promote the show this season includes both Adamas, and executive producer Ron Moore said in an interview the final Cylon is not depicted in that image.\nThe empty cup is supposed to represent the last Cylon. You can see the photo (and watch a 10-minute promo of tonight\u2019s episode) here.\nEric has a new theory. The four revealed at the end of season three \u2014 Tigh, Tyrol, Tory and Samuel T. Anders \u2014 all had a \"T\" in their names. That could set up Kara Thrace or Tom Zarek as the final Cylon. But Eric thinks that\u2019s actually a weak theory.\nEric and Maria were kicking around some ideas in an earlier email thread. I will set this up by saying the promo video implies D\u2019Anna is telling Laura Roslin, the ailing colonial president played by Mary McDonnell, that she (Roslin) is a Cylon.\nEric: Roslin doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s reacting to D\u2019Anna. She reacts to something, but I think she would look much more horrified if she was just told she was a Cylon.\nMaria: I thought it was (Felix) Gaeta too, but after seeing how manipulative (Romo) Lampkin was, he\u2019s got another vote. Can I get two votes?\nEric: It\u2019s not Romo. Besides, he\u2019s not on the base ship.\nMaria: Neither is Tyrol or Tigh.\nEric: Well, if we believe D\u2019Anna is going to out the final Cylon tonight, that person would have to be on the base ship.\nMy personal feeling is that it\u2019s Gaeta but I\u2019m intrigued by the idea it\u2019s Cottle. We know that it\u2019s a skin job. Hypothetically, it could be several different characters who have already been killed before the story even began. Hence, the empty place at the \"table\" of the story of BSG characters.\nHowever, if we take them at their word that the final cylon is not in the picture, only consider \"live\" characters, believe it is someone of significance, and somewhat known, the choices are narrowed to Felix Gaeta, Dee Dualla, Doc Cottle and Romo Lampkin. I believe it should be someone who has been there since the beginning, which excludes Lampkin. Dee is just too boring. Gaeta and Cottle have both been flying somewhat under the cylon-suspicion radar. Someone I know also pointed out that Cottle is missing from the cast on scifi.com\u2026 just like he might be missing from the picture.\nUPDATE (includes spoiler): Well, no new Cylon was named. The preview tease remark from D\u2019Anna to Roslin was \u2026 a joke! Funny Cylon!\nWow. What a monumental mind-frak, if I may. I\u2019m glad I threw the remote at the couch instead of the TV. Once again the BSG team has taken us to the brink and left us hanging.\nMy money is still on Gaeta. Over the past four seasons, he has quietly become a pretty important cast member. The four of the final five that we already know were big players in the resistance on New Caprica, and Gaeta also played a very big role in the anti-Cylon efforts.\nOf course, I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t hear the funky version of \"All Along the Watchtower\" in the season three finale\u2026which leads into a crackpot theory I had after that episode: Maybe the final Cylon is already on Earth. Maybe it\u2019s Bob Dylan.",

The Emmy Award-winning producer made \"Becoming Warren Buffett\" between 2014 and 2016, after five visits to Omaha, where Buffett resides.\n\"Like everybody, I wondered how this experience would help me personally with my finances. What lesson am I going to learn that's going to make me rich like Warren?\" Kunhardt told CNBC. \"There is no answer to that.

You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.\"\nSimply put, stick to what you know. \"Defining what your game is \u2014 where you're going to have an edge \u2014 is enormously important,\" Buffett tells Kunhardt in the documentary.

    "text": "Evo Morales, Bolivia's president-elect, fresh from meetings with the leaders of Cuba and Venezuela, says that his country welcomes foreign investors, but it will not relinquish control of its natural resources.\n\"Bolivia needs partners, foreign investors, but not owners of our natural resources,\" Morales told reporters on Wednesday in Madrid where he was stopping as part of a continuing tour that includes visits to France, Belgium, South Africa, China and Brazil.\n\"My government ... is going to exercise its property right over its natural resources.\"\nHe also said that his government will not tolerate foreign companies that do not respect the law in Bolivia.\n\"We're going to have a radical attitude with all those oil companies that do not comply with Bolivian law, those that do not pay taxes, those that are smugglers,\" he said.\nSpeaking after meeting Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the prime minister of Spain, Morales said he had told him that Spain would pardon nearly all of Bolivia's debt to the country in exchange for investment in education programmes, a measure the Spanish premier has been keen to apply to many Latin American countries.\nBolivia's debt to Spain is estimated at US$120 million.\n\"This is a great relief for me,\" Morales said.\n\"We want to put an end to our country's illiteracy rate.\"\nMorales then met King Juan Carlos at Zarzuela Palace on Madrid's outskirts.\n\"We're going to have a radical attitude with all those oil companies that do not comply with Bolivian law\"\nMorales arrived at Madrid's international airport aboard a Venezuelan jet provided by Hugo Chavez.\nOn Thursday, Morales flies to Brussels.\nIn the morning, he held talks with Miguel Angel Moratinos, the foreign minister of Spain, Jose Montilla, the industry minister, the Spanish employers' organisation and representatives of the Spanish-Argentine Repsol YPF oil company.\nSpeaking later, Montilla said he was confident his country could maintain smooth relations with Bolivia.\nHe said that international energy companies operating in Bolivia \"may see some changes in the rules of the game\", but also noted that Morales was aware of the role that Spanish and international companies play in job and income creation across Bolivia.\nAt one point during the news conference, he said he still could not believe that he was elected president and he compared his movement with that of socialist icon Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara.\nBut unlike Guevara, he said, he would work democratically for change, based on \"votes, not on bullets\".\nMorales's campaign promises to nationalise Bolivia's oil and natural gas was high on the agenda of his visit.\nThe tour is aimed at drumming up support for his incoming government, the first headed by an Indian in Bolivia's 180-year history, and also to show that he can hold his own on the world stage.\nSpain's Repsol YPF, which has invested US$1.08 billion in Bolivia, is one of the main foreign energy companies operating in the country.\nBolivia's proven and potential reserves total 53.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is second only to Venezuela in South America, according to the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration.",

    "text": "Our two-day extensive riding shows that the Royal Enfield Himalayan is a motorcycle that one can take to the Himalayas or to the corner grocery store with equal ease.\nThe Royal Enfield Himalayan doesn\u2019t look vastly different from most touring motorcycles; it\u2019s just that it is slightly smaller.\nHis grandfather called it a Bullet; his father called it a Bullet; until last Saturday Rakesh Kumar used to call it a Bullet. For three generations this family from the remote town of Thanedar near Shimla has been managing apple orchards, and riding Royal Enfield motorcycles. Even though Kumar now rides the Thunderbird, he and the whole town calls it the Bullet. Such strong is the brand name of the world\u2019s longest running production motorcycle model.\nBut when Kumar looks at the Royal Enfield I am riding, he changes his mind. \u201cIt just cannot be a Bullet,\u201d he says. Observing closely, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s the Himalayan.\u201d The Himalayan is a motorcycle purpose-built for adventure and touring. The company says that it brings together 60 years of Himalayan riding experiences in a fully ground-up design. Powered by the new 411cc, single-cylinder air-cooled engine, which produces a maximum output of 24.5bhp and a maximum torque of 32Nm, the Himalayan is built on a rugged duplex split cradle frame designed and developed by Harris Performance\u2014the UK-based motorcycle racing and parts manufacturer that Royal Enfield acquired last year.\nThe Himalayan doesn\u2019t look vastly different from most touring motorcycles; it\u2019s just that it is slightly smaller. And smaller means compared to, say, the Triumph Tiger range. But then, for Rs 1.55 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai), it is considerably cheaper too.\nThe front end, like most touring bikes, is tall. The front suspension is telescopic, with 41mm forks and 200mm travel. The monoshock rear suspension with linkage allows for 180mm wheel travel. We rode it on various kinds of roads\u2014freshly laid tarmac, no tarmac, waterlogged roads, and snow. The Himalayan, surprisingly, regardless of the terrain, delivered a smooth, untiring ride experience. Its 220mm ground clearance ensures it can, with some careful manoeuvring, even cross shallow river beds. The ground clearance, combined with an optimal wheel size\u2014the front tyre is 21-inch and the rear is 17-inch\u2014allows for good control while riding over a rocky terrain. The wheelbase of 1465mm means the bike handles twisty roads very well. Mention must be made of the Ceat dual-purpose tyres that the Himalayan rides on; they provide ample grip on almost all kinds of terrain. While we are yet to ride it on the highway, we have reasons to believe that the highway ride experience won\u2019t be tiring either. The seat height is 800mm, so even short riders won\u2019t feel intimidated sitting on the bike; however, the rear end is high, so taking your leg all the way to the other end, for short riders I mean, can be slightly difficult.\nWhat also leads to a comfortable ride experience is the ergonomic sync between footpegs, handlebar and seat height\u2014all of which provide an upright riding posture necessary for long trips. The disc brakes\u2014300mm front and 240mm rear\u2014have enough bite but the Himalayan, as of now, doesn\u2019t get the ABS.\nThe Royal Enfield Himalayan gets a 15-litre fuel tank, which, according to the company, provides a range of approximately 450 km. (That means the bike\u2019s fuel-efficiency is about 30kpl.) The good thing is that luggage-mounting points, for hard panniers, soft luggage and jerry cans, are integral to the Himalayan\u2019s design. One of the best things about the motorcycle is its instrument cluster. It has a simple yet well-laid-out design that keeps track of speed, direction (has a compass), ambient temperature, travel time, service intervals and multiple trip distances. However, the thermometer is perhaps fitted at such a place where the engine heat reaches, so sometimes it gives wrong readings\u2014but the difference is only of a degree or two. It doesn\u2019t get an altimeter, which, we believe, is a fun feature for such a machine.\nThis machine is not about a 0-60kph experience, but more about a 40-100kph one. Compared to smaller Japanese bikes, the Himalayan is not as quick initially, but once you pick up speed, and if you are in the right gear, it can even give the Honda CBR250R enough panic. The engine delivers high torque and usable power at lower RPMs, so this means minimal gear shifts. As we found, even at a low speed of 40kph you can shift into the fifth gear and cruise effortlessly. So be it climbing the hills or manoeuvring through traffic, your left foot can rest. The company claims that modern design and materials of the engine translate to increased efficiency and low maintenance, and the engine can go 10,000 km between oil changes.\nAvailable in two colour options\u2014cleverly called granite and snow\u2014the Royal Enfield Himalayan\u2019s on-road Mumbai price is Rs 1.79 lakh, which, we believe, is a steal. It allows both seasoned riders as well as enthusiasts to do more with just one motorcycle. Our two-day extensive riding shows that it appears to be a motorcycle that one can take to the Himalayas or to the corner grocery store with equal ease. Lastly, nowhere on the Himalayan you will find the Royal Enfield slogan \u201cMade like a gun\u201d, because the Himalayan is not really made like a gun, but like how a motorcycle should be.\nRoyal Enfield has also introduced a purpose-built protective riding gear that caters to the long-range tour travelling to unpredictable places, terrain or climate. It includes the four-season Royal Enfield Darcha riding suit made in collaboration with REV\u2019IT; and versatile touring jackets and trousers with Cordura, protective armour, removable thermal liners and breathable waterproof lining. The collection also has riding gloves, riding trousers and riding boots.",

    "text": "Today\u2019s mobile operating system landscape presents choices for industrial enterprises when it comes to selecting the platform upon which their applications should be built.\nWhen you think about a global enterprise distributing internal mobile solutions, you\u2019re talking about regional divides with different carriers, bands, and technologies used across different countries. Accounting for these divisions, global industrial players are demanding longer firmware lifecycles, as they realise that upgrades for a given solution may not be available for all devices across an enterprise every year.\nThis is why, when it comes to industrial mobility, it\u2019s critical to anticipate and plan ahead for mobile OS trends. For example, Windows Mobile (now Windows Embedded Handheld) and Windows CE (neither of which should not be confused with the new Windows Phone) are supported until 2020, but given the time it takes to develop, distribute, and support a solution used globally \u2013 and not to mention the long latency between upgrades \u2013 companies relying on these platforms had better already be thinking about the transition to their next OS.\nNeither enterprises nor industrial mobile app providers want to rely on or develop for Betamax in a VHS world, so to speak.\nAgainst this backdrop, it\u2019s critical to look at worldwide mobile OS trends and make informed predictions about user needs and how best to meet the global demand. When support for a platform ends, applications used by businesses need to be rewritten for a new platform.\nToday, there are easily 15 million enterprise devices in this position of being dependent on a legacy Windows OS with the clock running out on its support and in need of a replacement. In many ways this represents an opportunity: companies commissioning new industrial mobility apps can redesign to work in more current features such as multi-touch, gestures, current best UI practices, etc.\nThose forced to change from Windows Embedded Handheld or Windows CE to a new OS have options, including Windows 10 and Android, both of which will require a software re-build (unfortunately for users of Microsoft\u2019s products, a simple Windows-to-Windows update won\u2019t do the job).\nWindows 10 has been designed to meet the needs of enterprise, including enterprise-grade security, identity, and information protection features, and simplified management and deployment. As such, the OS could prove a viable enterprise option for those wishing to stay in the Microsoft camp (albeit with the aforementioned re-build if, coming from a sunsetting OS).\nBut that said: given the recent news that Microsoft is taking a $7.6 billion write-down of Nokia (including deep job cuts largely affecting the company\u2019s phone business), those prudently watching the industry must consider that this year\u2019s planned launch of Windows 10 Mobile may now be less certain. Windows 10 retains its strong promise as a major OS and a tablet OS, but in the mobile space it should currently be seen as just a potential candidate.\nAndroid, though, with nearly 80 per cent of the worldwide market according to IDC (iOS is a distant second with roughly 20 per cent of the market), is perhaps best positioned to be the dominant mobile OS in enterprise settings. Enterprise developers have been flocking to adopt Android: a Vision Mobile report finds that Android is now the OS most commonly targeted by enterprise developers, with iOS and HTML5 also used by the majority of developers (who, on average, develop for 1.75 platforms \u2013 and in the case of HTML5, develop code that is translated into native apps).\nAndroid has also risen to meet the needs of the enterprise by evolving into a more secure platform. Initial perceptions of Android containing security issues likely stemmed from early malware on the Google Play app distribution platform (to which, of course, any secure enterprise app should not be allowing unfiltered access). There were also early Android releases, prior to October 2011, in which key security features were missing (but are now available), such as extensible VPN support, full drive encryption, encrypted credential stores, etc.\nBoth Android and, likely, Windows 10 offer the capacity to reduce enterprise OS fragmentation, to provide tools enterprises need, and to continually add new enterprise features \u2013 as well as to leverage workers\u2019 familiarity with platform interfaces they may have from at-home use. For enterprises using Windows OSes that sunset in the next two to three years, there are strong options, and it\u2019s the right time to begin preparing for the next OS.",

He hasn't raped, nor even thieved.\nHe has tampered with a passport, and he has clearly gotten involved with dangerous people, and handled money on their behalf.\nI can understand the victims of terrorism wanting justice - though as far as I can see, this man was a pawn.\nHe should have been sentenced, but I question those calling for a long prison sentence.\nThe function of the courts is to implement the law. If society thinks that confessions should be admitted even when obtained in unacceptable circumstances, then there is a very simple solution: The government can change the law. If the government does that, then the courts will apply the new rules.\nOf course, changing the law so that confessions obtained under duress become admissible would be a politically difficult step.\nDon't blame the courts for refusing to do the government's dirty work.\nTerrorism threatens our way of life and our freedom. This includes our right to a fair trial, due process and freedom from torture or duress by the state. What's the point of having democratic processes distorted by governments cowed by callow commentators and mindless media screaming 'Jihad Jack' headlines? We just substitute one form of terrorism with another.\nAs Alan Atwwod put it in today's Age, \"Railing against Appeal Court judges who called it as they saw it in the flawed case against Joseph Thomas is to invoke an ugly kind of journalistic jihad.\"\nI am tiring fast of this wannabe member to the commentariat - I am sure he yearsn to sit alongside Andrew Bolt or David Marr on the ABCs Insiders program.\nIf we are fighting a war on terror - at the very least we are fighting for the preservation a society governed under the rule of law - not opinion, or fear or political whim but law - and even if there are anachronistic elements to the exisiting code it is up to us to change them under principles which we have followed since federation - if there is anything we can claim to be an Australian \"Value\" or a clearly identifiable part of our 'way of life\" - excuse me while I puke - it is a commitment to the rule of law.\nSylvia Else is right that security services, including the AFP, only have the option of working within the law.\nIf the Government (the AFP) wants to bring Jihad Jack (JJ) before the Courts in the hope he might be convicted it has to accept the decision of the judiciary on major points of law.\n- Fortunately JJ is likely to be tried again on the basis of the Four Corners interview.\n- JJ should bless his luck that he was saved by the AFP officers from further torture and possible death in the Pakistani jail. He may also have been sent to Guantanamo to join hiss buddy David Hicks.\n- Given the AFP's helping hand to JJ and that JJ's confession organised by the AFP officers in close communications and agreement with the AFP hierarchy it is ludicrous for Mirko to suggest that the AFP officers should be disciplined. Does Mirko want suspects to be condemned or policemen?\n- In addition to JJ being released as a threat to the community the cost of keeping tabs on him would be likely running into $1,000s per day (tax payers money and the resources are better used elsewhere).\nBTW I'd say that if Hicks returned from Guantanamo there would be less evidence against him than on JJ under current Australian law - hence the Government has not been overhasty in calling for Hick's return.\nMirko, I totally agree with you. This law is a joke. If an officer has acted improperly then they should deal with the officer. But they should still present all evidence collected, together with the manner that it was collected, to the Judge so all the information can be available in the case for the Judge/Jury to make a decision.\nI am sure the Judges and people on the Jury are smart enough work out what is right and wrong.",

Your dehumidifier was actually using ~ 360W all the time --> 0.36kWh --> 8.6kWh/day --> assuming 10cents /kWh --> 86cents / day which is pretty close to the drop you saw.\"\nWhile they are yet to show up on my energy bill (we have a flat rate bill due to massive summer spikes), these savings are likely to add up fast and, if similar savings were achieved by others, they would easily pay for the cost of the monitor within a year or two. Of course, I could have simply walked around checking for appliances that had been left on\u2014but Sense provided both the impetus to do so, and some actual data about whether it was worth the effort.\nWhat's interesting to me\u2014although perhaps obvious\u2014is that as more devices get detected, it also becomes easier to figure out what's left under \"other\" or \"always on\". The majority of our lights, our fridge, our washing machine and both cars are yet to be detected\u2014for example\u2014but each of these devices are used quite differently, so I can easily look for spikes in those categories to figure out roughly how much my car is using, for example.\nTrue, Sense is certainly still learning and is far from infallible. I've still got a fair amount of mystery devices named \"Heat 1\" or \"Device 2\", etc. -- but many of these are relatively low consumption, so I'm not sweating too much about figuring out what they are. Which brings me to one more point: One of the unexpected benefits of installing Sense has been figuring out what NOT to worry about any more. Having been berated by tree hugging friends never to leave a phone charger plugged in, for example, I've done some playing around and now noticed that it's drawing less than a watt at any one time. Forgive me for my callousness, polar bears, but I really can't bring myself to prioritize this action. Unplugging my computer monitor, however, is a much more effective way to make a difference.",

    "text": "Iwant to use my column this Sunday to address the sickening level of hypocrisy demonstrated by the Muhammadu Buhari administration and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission under the leadership of its acting Chairman, Ibrahim Magu.\nHopefully, the electoral theft carried out by President Buhari and his co conspirators will be reversed by the Supreme Court when it treats the petition brought by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\nHowever, before then, Nigerians would be well advised to prepare themselves for more of the same because it is quite first that the Buhari administration has no intention of changing its tune. They wasted the last four years blaming everyone but themselves for the series of catastrophes that they passed of for governance and they are about to do the same for the foreseeable future.\nBoth President Buhari and his vice, Pastor Yemi Osinbajo have set the tone, which has been followed by their subordinates.\nOn Thursday March 28, 2019, Premium Times ran with the headline \u2018Osinbajo Blames Past Governments for Nigeria\u2019s Lack of Progress\u2019. If this is the best we will get after four years, then imagine how their so called \u2018Next Level\u2019 will be?\nAnd then Ibrahim Magu took blaming to an absurd level by accusing the immediate past regime, of which I was a part of, of looting 1.3 trillion Naira between 2011 and 2015 and declaring that the administration under whom he is serving is on a clean up mission.\nThis is just ridiculous and I will disprove it via facts.\nIt is a lie that 1.3 trillion was looted out of Nigeria. That amount is equivalent to $8 billion when you factor in the pre 2015 value of the Naira to the dollar.\nWho looted those funds? Mr. Magu should name names instead of naming figures.\nThe only time that anything near that amount was stolen from Nigeria was during the kleptocracy of the self promoted General Sani Abacha.\nWhen I read law in England, my university\u2019s case study for FSA fraud was General Abacha, who looted at least $5 billion. Yet President Muhammadu Buhari famously said \u2018Abacha did not steal\u2019.\nNigerians seem to have forgotten that the Abacha family was allowed to keep about $1.2 billion out of the amount that their bloodthirsty buffoon of a father looted from Nigeria.\nIn fact, a stadium is named after that common thief in Kano!\nAbacha\u2019s widow even once boasted that she brought President Buhari into politics and his son, Mohammed Abacha, who I personally interviewed when he was at Kirikiri Maximum Security prison, continues to maintain that the money traced to his family was earned legitimately.\nEven today, Abacha loot is still being discovered in sundry places all over the world. Just seven months ago, Switzerland repatriated $320 million worth of Abacha loot, and this is the idiot that President Buhari said did not steal?\nWhat has Ibrahim Magu done to recover the money that is still being held by the Abacha family? What has he done to stem the grand corruption that is ongoing all around President Muhammadu Buhari?\nA month after clear evidence of bullion vans ferrying cash into Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s house in violation of the 2011 Money Laundering Act making it illegal for individuals to make cash payments exceeding N5,000,000, the EFCC has not said or done anything.\nTinubu Even had audacity to boast that, yes, the bullion vans ferried money and it is no one\u2019s business. This happened 48 hours to an election. If I or any other opposition figure has done this, we would be in jail by now. Why is Tinubu sitting pretty?\nA renowned entertainer, Charly Boy admitted to receiving a 9 figure payment from the spokesman to the Buhari campaign, Festus Keyamo. Has the EFCC investigated this? Where does Festus (Stephanie Otobo) Keyamo have N100,000,000 to throw about carelessly?\nTill today Ibrahim Magu\u2019s EFCC never investigated the $25 billion NNPC contract awarded without due process. To put this in perspective, that money can pay 1 million Nigerians the proposed new minimum wage of N30,000 for 4 years. To whom was it paid?\nTwo years after conclusion of investigation, the Buhari administration and the EFCC have still not told us who owns the Ikoyi Apartment Billions. If that money where traceable to Goodluck Jonathan or PDP , the whole world would have heard by now.\nMagu said he cannot investigate or prosecute Gov Umar Ganduje because he has immunity, but the same Magu\u2019s EFCC charged Akwa-Ibom Governor, Udom Emmanuel, in the NBA President\u2019s bribery case. No wonder Chibuike Amaechi said APC members are \u2018God fearing.\nWhen the Senate tried to prove how Maina, the biggest thief in Nigeria\u2019s civil service history, was reinstated and double promoted, it was Buhari\u2019s Minister of Justice who ran to court to secure an injunction to stop the investigation. Magu didn\u2019t see that?\nThe truth is that the EFCC under Ibrahim Magu is the armed wing of the APC. No wonder Ibrahim Magu wore a Buhari re-election lapel pin. No wonder his EFCC almost collected a \u2018donation\u2019 from Governor Umar Ganduje until a public alarm was raised.\nWhat has happened to Senator Akpabio\u2019s case? When he was PDP, the EFCC harassed him left, right and centre. Soon as he joined APC you forgot his case. The acting EFCC Chairman should understand that his name is Magu, not Mugu. Can he stop acting like a Mugu.\nTo show how hypocritical Ibrahim Magu\u2019s EFCC is, they declared Orji Uzor Kalu wanted. The wanted Orji Uzor Kalu was shown dancing with Buhari, was appointed by Aisha Buhari and now wants to be Deputy Senate President. Only under Magu the hypocrite.\nThe fact remains that Ibrahim Magu is incompetent and both mentally and intellectually unsuited for the job of EFCC Chairman. Cast your mind to the way he fumbled at simple questions during his Senate confirmation hearing. Unlike Nuhu Ribadu, he does not have the character to stand up to his boss.\nUnder him, Nigeria has made its worse retrogression in the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index. Whereas under Jonathan and the PDP, Nigeria made her best ever improvement on Transparency International\u2019s CPI, moving 8 places forward from 144 to 136 in 2014, but under President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, Nigeria has made her worst ever retrogression, moving backwards 12 places from 136 to 148.\nIt was under Magu, that the Egmont Group and the Financial Action Task Force suspended Nigeria for lack of autonomy at the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit because Magu\u2019s EFCC kept on unprofessionally using the financial intelligence they were fed to blackmail political opponents of the Buhari government.\nI challenge Ibrahim Magu to list his achievements. The only tangible thing I can give him credit for is building the over priced new headquarters of the EFCC at an astonishing N24 billion ($70 million). To put this in perspective, this is more than it cost to build the offices of England\u2019s version of the EFCC who have a larger staff and mandate than the EFCC.\nIt is just that President Buhari runs a nepotistic government. If not, how would a man with such low mentality as Ibrahim Magu ever rise to the top of the EFCC when Nigeria has policemen of such sterling character and courage as CP Mohammed Wakil, the Kano State Commissioner of Police?\nDear wives, don\u2019t just be your husband\u2019s wife. Be his side chick and slay queen. Gym. Look trim. Slow down on carbs. Eat deliciously but healthily. Be proactive in pleasing each other in the bedroom and he won\u2019t have strength to look outside. Dear men, once you marry, avoid being alone with other women. Looking at some women\u2019s BACKSIDE can make you BACKSLIDE. Focus on the back that you have back at home. Don\u2019t allow any EVE\u2019s APPRENTICE make you back out of your marriage vows #RenosNuggets.",
